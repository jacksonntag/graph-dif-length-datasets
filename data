1,OBE,1054,27,,F,"my consciousness popped out of my body and up over the SUV. I was floating about three feet above the roof. I could see the burgundy color, along with the four metal strips that were supposed to pass for a luggage rack. I took a greater interest in the lush trees and foliage to my right as the SUV continued along the bridge and the land dropped away. With just the slightest desire to have a closer look, I plunged over the side of the bridge and followed the tree line all the way down to the river, a considerable drop of 876 feet. I could see every leaf, every detail. As I skimmed over the water, I could see every rock beneath its surface. Then I headed back up the other side, keeping pace with the SUV my body still resided in. I came along side the vehicle, but I was still curious about the landscape, so I willed myself to separate from the SUV and go off on my own. I had no fear of doing this. I did not feel any excitement or anxiety. I only felt peace, joy and fascination. As I continued to float along the tops of the trees, however, they began to change. They no longer looked like earthly trees. The greens became iridescent, billowing, undulating. Then other colors were added to the greens \xe2\x80\x93 otherworldly colors that glowed as if lit from behind by the sun.

2,DEE,1177,43,,F,"After hanging up the phone with my younger sister, I said out loud that as a family we could not endure another experience with cancer. My father had died of a glioblastoma at age 54 in 1978. I prayed with concern over my sisters initial test results and began to cry uncontrollably. Very suddenly, I began to feel an exceptionally warm energy burning beneath my stomach but above my abdomen. This warm energy began slowly traveling up through the center of my body. By the time it entered my head, I had received knowledge that my sisters test results would turn out to show a benign condition. I cant describe how I knew this, but I was 100% certain that that would be the outcome and I had received this knowledge from some knowing entity. At the same time this was happening to me, my cat in the hallway started showing very peculiar behavior. He was standing on 3 legs with one of his front legs in the air a position Ive never seen a cat take. In addition, he seemed to be in a trance. When I called his name, he could not hear me. His head was moving slowly from side to side, left to right, like he was transfixed by some image. I looked in the direction of his gaze and saw nothing but darkness. He stayed in this position with these movements for several minutes in a trance-like state. After this was all over for him and me, I phoned my sister back and told her of my experience and told her she had absolutely nothing to worry about concerning the tests she was to take the next day and that I was phoning her now so the next day when she had the tests she would have proof of the truthfulness of my experience.

It was absolute unconditional love and a clear message came into my head that love is the essential truth.

The classroom looked a little different, in that it had windows on three sides. There were students sitting quietly in the classroom, and the light was out. I could see the students sitting in the dark, and I wondered why they were sitting there in the dark when I could see a light coming from under one of the doors. I remember thinking that it was ok if they wanted to sit in the dark but that I wanted to go toward the light. As I opened the door I was surrounded by the brightest light I have every seen, so bright that it would normally cause one to close their eyes. It was the most warm, most loving, most peaceful experience- words cannot describe it. At the same time I realized I could see all around me, that I was not a body standing in the light but I was one with the light. I had no face, no eyes, no body. I dont know how long I was there.

I got to approximately 20 yards from shore when I was unable to go any further and rested with the victim on a small sandbar.

11,ADC,1514,40,,F,"I was sleeping with my 9 year old son, Connor. My brother, Tripp, came to wake me up to tell me that my step-mother had called to tell him my father had passed away. I believe the time was 2:36 a.m. or close to that. When Tripp whispered to my from the hallway, I immediately jolted awake. I knew why he was waking me. He told me that he was going to my dads house, but that I should not go. I went downstairs to tell my husband that my dad had passed. Looking back, I was very calm. I was not crying or upset. My dad and I had an extremely close relationship. I was wide awake, so it was not that I wasnt fully understanding, I just wasnt upset for some reason. I went back upstairs and quietly got back in bed so as not to wake up my son. As soon as I lay back down, I fell back to sleep with no problem at all. (Another thing that seems strange given the situation.) It seems as soon as I feel asleep, I wasnt really sleep anymore, but sitting on my couch at my own home in Savannah. I looked up from my couch down the hall to my front door. Our front door has glass panes in it. Through the panes, I could see my dad standing there. He looked young like he did when I was a little girl. He had on seersucker pants, a starched white shirt and a bright yellow tie. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I slowly walked to the door. Time seemed to go very slowly. He was patiently waiting and just smiling at me through the glass, his eyes never leaving mine. As I made my way to the door, I knew that he shouldnt be there. I also wondered how I got from the bed at my brothers house to my house in Savannah. I knew that he was gone and should not be here on earth. As I opened the door, he smiled, and said, Hey there, Sweet Girl...I promised you I would come back to see you in Savannah. I just stood there for what seemed like a long time and then slowly walked to him and started to hug him, but then I remembered the pain it caused when I hugged him because of the tumors in his abdomen. But he sensed my hesitation, and said, It is OK Sweet Girl. You cant hurt me anymore. There is no more pain. Then he walked through the front door, into my foyer and straight up my staircase where he just kind of vanished...I stood and watched him walk away, then I just immediately woke up, and I was wide awake, and the dream was as real and vivid as if I had just been standing at my front door. I was not groggy at all or scared or sad. I was so happy and comforted that he had come to me. I could still feel our hug. I looked at the clock and less than 40 minutes had passed since my brother had come in to tell me that my dad had passed away. I lay there for over an hour replaying the dream. Then as I was falling asleep, I begged and begged him to come back.

Young men were sitting in it, hearing loud music. I did not really pay attention to them and turned into another street, which was much darker. Suddenly a really strong invisible force hit me, and I staggered into a dark corner near a house. I almost fell, and was shocked. 2 seconds later the same car with the young men appeared in the street. This time they were driving very slowly as if they were looking for something/someone. They could not see me, as I was still in the dark corner of a house. They passed me again, this time the music was off. I realized later that they must have been looking for me. I struggled to get myself together in the corner where I was still crouching. I was shocked because it was clearly not me, who decided to hide in the corner. It was as if someone/something had hit me or shoved me there. I went home at last but I have not told anybody about this experience for a long time, not even my husband.

17,DEE,1299,22,,M,"I entered my bedroom, sat down on a cushioned window seat, and the sobbing continued. Moments later, I felt a tingling in my arms, kind of like they had fallen asleep, though I wasnt sitting in a way that impaired blood flow. Moments later, my arms rose from my sides and my hands literally came together in prayer in front of my chest. I watched in complete wonderment as this occurred. And I suddenly felt in my heart a very clear instruction that I needed to get on my knees and pray. But I was refused. I didnt understand why prayer was necessary. In fact, it seemed like an act of subservience that made me uneasy. Meanwhile, my arms and hands were literally vibrating, and my hands were stuck together that literally, I was unable to pull them apart. Why is this happening to me, I wondered. And I suddenly understood that I was dying. No sooner did that thought cross my mind, my hands fell back to my sides--thus making a connection in my mind between the thought I was dying and the release of my hands from the unseen force, and the immediate cessation of the tingling sensations. Given how strange this all was, it seemed perfectly logical to me that I was indeed dying. My mother was spiritual, so I thought I better go downstairs and tell her. In the living room, I sat beside my mother and told her what had just happened. She told me to go ahead and pray. I told her I couldnt, and that I was dying. She was very spiritual. When she heard this, she thought perhaps a part of me was dying, to make room for something else... but I wasnt physically dying. I told her she was wrong. She checked my temperature. I had a fever of 103. She went to get some aspirin, and told me to to relax. After I took the aspirin, I lay down on the living room couch, and thats when a spiritual being showed up. I heard him as clear as day, talking in my head, just as if he was in the room with me. The first thing he said to me was, Ok, lets go! When he said that, I could feel a pulling sensation all of a sudden on the region of my solar plexus. If the soul was real, it felt like he was reaching in and pulling my soul out of my body. It was a very uncomfortable and unusual feeling, and I reacted to it by kicking my feet on the couch. When I did this, the pulling, or suction-y feeling stopped. Long story short, this fight to stay went on for more than an hour. I remained lucid throughout the whole experience, conversing with my family while also telepathically conversing with this Being. The longer I resisted, the more this Being resorted to threatening me. I didnt care--no matter what the threats (Stay and youll be crazy, no one will ever understand you, your family wont remember a thing--their memories will be wiped) I refused to go wherever it was this Being was intent on taking me. Finally, fed up with my refusal, the Being told me he wasnt leaving empty handed. If I didnt come then and there, he would cause my father to have a massive heart attack, and he would take my father. My father and I had had a long and stormy relationship, however, I didnt have to think about that threat. I immediately relented and agreed to come. But I asked to say goodbye to my family first--which he permitted. I literally kissed and hugged everyone who was there and said goodbye. It was the saddest moment I have ever experienced. Then I told the Being I was finally ready, and I heard a voice (a different voice than the Being) tell me it wasnt my time. For a while I pleaded to go. I was ready. But it was no use. My fever broke, and I felt better than I had ever felt in my life-- and I appreciated my life like I had never appreciated it before.

Terry\xe2\x80\x99s battle with cancer started in 2007-where it was diagnosed in the colon. He was successfully operated on in September that year and recovered, remaining healthy until March 2009, when a tumour was removed from his small intestine. He received chemotherapy at Tygerberg Hospital afterwards and seemed well. He continued to play his gigs-he said the music took his mind away from the pain. His last gig was just after New Year 2012 at the Shuntin\xe2\x80\x99 Shed in Bot River-but he was very weak by then.  The last six months of his life, he was cared for at home-with the help of Hospice. Terry slipped into a coma on Thursday 28th June-I spoke to him and told him it was alright to move on, that his daughters T&#232;gan and Tullia, and I, would be fine. I also asked him to send me a sign when he crossed over. He passed away in the early hours of Friday morning. He was smiling. I knew he had left us, and in the early winter morning, I looked out of the window up at the grey sky-completely overcast except for a very defined sliver of blue sky- in the perfect shape of an electric guitar. I was so grateful for that sign. Terry had asked a good friend of his to sell his beloved Fender Telecaster (which he bought in America) to help support his family-as he had been unable to work for months. I was told that the lady who bought it was called Tracy; and she had bought it for her partner, John, whom we had never met, as they live near Johannesburg. The morning of Terry\xe2\x80\x99s passing; I received a call from Tracy, enquiring how Terry was. I told her that he had passed away in the early hours of that morning. She gave me condolences and put John on the phone. This is what he told me: On the night in question, at about 11:45 p.m. my very faithful dog, Sasha, nudged me with her nose and would not stop...until I got out of bed. I was at my farm, not far from Hartebeespoort Dam at the time. Only to find Sasha sitting next to the Fender case... I made a cup of coffee, called my dog to the kitchen and she would not budge. I know that it sounds weird, but, I had to play the telecaster... my dog left the room as soon as I plugged the guitar into the amp... played a few bars of John Lee Hooker and went to bed. As you know I phoned you the next morning to offer my condolences... how I knew that?... your Terry was with me, of that I am sure... I feel that he has been back, too often I find myself compelled to play the tele. Bear in mind, I have seven other guitars, all very good... but the tele keeps calling...??? The guitar is well and safe... I play the smoke out of it and love the mood it leaves me with... I am sure you understand what I mean by that. In any case, I have no opinion on the life here after, but, Terry Dean was with me and wanted to hear me play, to see if I was up to scratch, I think?

22,ADC,1144,57,,M,"Now, I must say that it is not completely uncommon to see deer in our yard although, for whatever reason, I hadnt seen any for a few months. I work from home and have a large window next to my desk that looks out over our back yard. I asked Christine to send deer because I felt it would be solid confirmation if, on the very day I asked to see deer, it actually happened. Unfortunately, on this particular day I was so consumed with work that I dont even remember looking out my window. By the time I realized it was already dark outside, I also realized I never saw any deer. I was terribly disappointed with myself that I hadnt come up for air all day. Did Christine send the deer and I missed the signal to look up and out the window? Or did she not hear my plea? Maybe Im making this all up after all. I have been working on my computer moving very large files around and so before going upstairs for dinner with my wife (Christines mom), I begin a disk compression operation that takes a significant amount of time. I click the start button and go to dinner.  After dinner I came back downstairs to see the progress for my disk compression. Its going very slowly. To pass some time I start poking around on one of the other hard drives to see whats on it.

It is BLACK! no stars, no planets, no lights, NOTHING! Void. A black hole I dont know what else to call it. Except in a very, very, very far distance is a very small gold and I mean GOLD light flickering like a candle or generator running off cycle or something. I began to get closer and closer. The GOLD light grew larger and larger and closer and closer. As I got close enough I could tell what looked like a snow globe or very lucent clear crystal ball and this GOLD light was inside this globe. As I got closer I could tell inside this globe were what looked like stars. Sort of looking into the sky from earth. But inside this globe these stars were very bright or a crystal or bright white. It is nothing I have ever seen before or can compare to it. There were no bright and dim stars, they were all the same. In this middle was this Golf glowing light. I did not go inside this and was kept at a distance hanging out in this blackness. On the way all I could feel is a state of AWE! no words, just a beyond any middle boggling experience anyone could have imagined. On this travel it was like your mind is wondering out there and focused on this GOLD light thinking what is going on?. Getting closer to this globe I noticed I began getting messages or bits of information or something that seem to be sending these messages to me. These messages begin telling me some things I need to work on. Which I did not understand at all. I am beginning to get a better understanding each day since.

38,DEE,1111,32,,F,"Sometime during the night, I began to dream. (Highly unusual because I NEVER remember dreams although I am sure that I do dream). I was present in this dream. I knew immediately that something unusual was happening. I was wearing a long white robe and I had sandals on my feet. It was very warm. I remember thinking wow why is it so warm in a dream this is way too real. Just then I bit down and felt a grain of sand between teeth. I stopped and said to myself wait, this is important because it is real. I walked between 2 buildings made of what looked like adobe to me and I kept walking until I entered a courtyard that was of good size. There were clusters of men standing around talking with one another and they were dressed somewhat like me except they had more colorful gear on. I remember thinking that I was in Bibical days by the way they looked. In the center of the yard were a group of boys playing some kind of ball. They were chasing a ball (that was really a bunch of rags tied together). They were kicking the ball back and forth and seemed intent on playing a game. As I looked around, over to my right was a young boy about 8 to 10 years old. He had that look of dejection about him. He was leaning against the wall with his left shoulder. He was looking down and was moving the sand around with his foot. My mother instinct kicked in and I felt compassion for the boy because I knew he had not been chosen to play. I moved over behind him and that is when I reached out and touched his shoulder. He turned and looked straight into my eyes. The air literally left me and I dropped to my knees. You see, it didnt matter that he was a boy I knew him. I knew him and I began to cry. It was the Savior. Without his lips moving, transferring language to me directly to my head (but more putting it into English falls so short; it was like a thought that came to me and then blew up inside my head) but I HEARD his voice and I knew it. How do I know it? I dont know but in that moment I remember saying Oh, I know that voice! I knew that I missed him so much. I knew that I had been bought and paid for (atonement)if I chose to allow it (free agency and all). I loved him. I sensed the largness of the universe and how there was no end . . . but wait . . . he spoke Cindy, I never fit in. From that statement I understood that he didnt have to show me the cross . . . he really means he was a weird human among humans. That is all that I heard . . . everything else is as real . . . it just was that odd hearing/listening thing. Here is the significant exchange to me . . . I felt the love. It is more than love, but on Earth that is what we say. I knew it was for EVERY single human who was going to live and who had ever lived. If was like I could have reached out and picked it up . . . it had substance. And, it hurt. The love was so much that it hurt and I was humbled by what I felt. It was over. I sat straight up in my bed and looked at the clock. It was 2 a.m. For the next few weeks, the feeling didnt leave me. Sometimes I would just look at a group of students on the BSU campus and want to burst into tears because I knew how much he loved them. Then, like all things, the memory started to fade. A few months later, I got down on my knees and begged for the gift of always remembering that feeling and the event. I dont think about it every day. I am 61 now. But, I can recall it all.

41,DEE,1541,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him.

I had said a little prayer (just in case) asking for forgiveness for those I had directly or indirectly hurt, and waited to die--so I thought. I wondered what it would feel like; i.e., would the lights just go out, would it be painful, or what. I could not tell the sex of my visitor, it appeared to clothed in a lovely robe-like material, was very human in appearance, had a lovely smile, appeared gentle and loving and I could see through it. What surprised me most is that it spoke to me without words. The thoughts just jumped into my mind. It knew what I wanted to know just as I had the thought develop in my mind, and I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d Looking back on the experience, that thought makes me smile every time I think about it--it really happened that way. The message was that of love, that it did not matter whether I lived or died--I would be cared for. Finally, the overriding message was, LOVE WAS ALL THAT MATTERED and I did not need to worry. The visitor stayed with me for some time (several minutes) and when I turned to look away, out the cabin window, I could see the lights of a city below. When I turned back, my visitor was gone. In a way, this proved how real the visitation was. It was NO dream. After the plane landed, I was met by an ambulance and taken to Daniel Freeman Hospital. Thinking that I had a Mexican GI upset I was taken to a ward treating GI problems, a nurse noticed that my blood pressure dropped to nearly zero, I was then rushed to a CC unit and placed under the care of a cardiologist, Dr. Ciralo (sp?). There I was diagnosed with severe cardiac dilatation and heart failure, it wasnt until later that a pheochromocytoma was discovered. I was severely hypertensive and apparently this was the cause of my heart failure. When my hypertensive condition was brought under control, my heart returned to normal. This was all documented by ultrasonography and angiography. The pheochromocytoma was removed from my abdomen 1 month later at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. I think back on the experience and still worry about the unknown, but listening to the audio tape of your book has helped restore my faith in the reality of my experience. Thank you!!

43,OBE,1521,43,,F,"I had a two part experience with this series. I had an OBE with the first and fourth meditation. In the first meditation I experienced a dropping down into my heart. Once that happened, I felt myself leave my physical body. I found myself in the rings of Saturn. I observed this area for a bit. I could feel something like wind and could hear the planet rotating. I watched as rocky material went by. I say watched, but it wasnt like watching with your eyes. I felt like I was going in a circular motion and felt like I was standing, but not really standing. I shifted my consciousness to look down because I felt like I had moved from the rings to somewhere else. I found my consciousness in the middle of the DNA helix. It seems like I stayed there for quite awhile and could feel a sense of awe. I felt in awe throughout this whole experience. I then found myself sort of floating in what felt and looked like darkness, but not scary darkness more like space darkness. I became aware of a shape, but it was on a mammoth scale. There is nothing that I can even compare it to. It felt like God, OM, greatness. I was then in the middle of what seemed like what would be comparable to the bloodstream. I was moving very fast and saw lots of red around me. This shifted from the bloodstream to the galaxies, other planets, humans, animals, trees, everything. I felt like I was being shown that everything is connected and on an even larger scale, we make (everything) actually makes up God/OM. We are the heart, everything is about the heart. In the 4th mediation I had a similar, but different experience. I dropped down into my heart again, but I stayed there for a bit. I had the sensation that I was laying on my left side. I could hear a muffled heart beat. Not a perfect beat and it sounded as if it may even be skipping beats, but so comforting. I became aware of the feeling of warm fluid all around me and inside my nose, lungs, mouth. I could see my right hand, but it was very tiny and very pink. It was mostly dark, but a little bit of white light was around the edges of this space. I felt as if this was me and I was in my mothers womb. I remember feeling the most comforted I ever have. It was so comforting, but also very confining, but not in a bad way. From there, I felt like I was in a white light spiral. The spiral shot the purest white light through my heart and out of the crown of my head-simultaneously. My consciousness catapulted out of my chest, but also through my head. Up, straight up and fast, but completely enveloped with white light and love. I felt like there were beings that were moving with me, supporting me, but they had no physical characteristics.

45,ME ,1287,57,,F,"On January 12, 2002 something pivotal happened that enabled me to open my mind to believe in God. My husband Hank and I were staying at a historic, antique-filled bed and breakfast, Butternut Farm, in Glastonbury, Connecticut. (I dont think the owners of this establishment would want it to be made public that their bed and breakfast is haunted.) It was Saturday night and we went to sleep on the comfortable and luxurious bed. In the middle of the night, I woke up, eyes wide open, and sat up tall in bed. Looking back on this experience, I must have looked like I was in one of those movies when someone is under a spell and rises from their sleep with their eyes wide open, back straight as a board. I didnt hear or smell anything and I wasnt touched by anything but I instantly turned my head to the left and saw something. About three feet away from me, suspended in mid air about eye level to me, was a ghost. The ghost was shaped like a huge, round, horizontal Bayer aspirin tablet. It was flat on the top and bottom with rounded edges. It was about two feet in diameter. The ghost was made up of thousands of tiny black particles, each shaped like a sperm, which furiously rotated clockwise as fast as a tornado. It spun around so violently that it spewed off some of the tiny black particles. But, although the ghost was just a couple of feet away and although it was spinning as fast as a tornado, I didnt feel a breeze and none of the particles touched me. It was as if the ghost was contained in its own little world, separate from my human world. This whole experience actually lasted just a few seconds, because as soon as I sat up and turned my head and my eyes saw the ghost, as if it saw me looking at it, it instantly broke down into an amoebic mob of black particles and made a mad dash for the closed old door and disappeared through the long crack of the warped frame. I sat up for a while thinking about this experience. Strangely, I did not feel fear because if I did, I would have awakened my husband. I did feel a sort of fear because I didnt want to put my head back down on the pillow, afraid to go back to sleep, afraid the ghost would return. But I was very tired and layed back down to ponder what I should do. The next thing I knew, it was morning. As soon as we woke up, I told Hank about the ghost. He just listened to me. He looked like he was believing me. I told him there probably was a small chance it was all a dream but I didnt think so. It didnt feel like a dream. It felt real and I remembered it in vivid detail. When we went downstairs for breakfast, I was so excited that I told everyone in the dining room what happened to me that night. The two owners mockingly pooh-poohed my story but there was a visiting pastor from Pennsylvania. She also stayed overnight because she was to give a sermon at a nearby church. She confirmed that she was also visited by the ghost. She said she didnt see what I saw but she woke up during the night and felt its presence sitting in a chair by her bed. She said that in her line of work, people often came to her with stories and issues concerning ghosts and spirits. With the pastor as witness, I was validated 100% that I did indeed see a ghost. Actually, I think this pastor was an Angel because in the days ahead I tried to reach her but I couldnt find her anywhere, even though she gave me her business card. It was as if she disappeared. Seeing the ghost was a shocking but crucial experience. It had served a greater purpose in my life than just to amaze me. It took about a year for me to digest and process the ghost before I could tell anyone else. Then I told a friend. After getting this experience out, I started to really think about the ghost. It suddenly dawned on me that I saw a ghost! The reality of seeing a ghost, I realized, became proof that there really was a spiritual world. Standing now on the threshold of this whole new world, my mind looked out and wondered: Wow! Now that I know there really is a spiritual world and that ghosts are real, what else can I believe in? The answer came in my very next breath: God. But, still, I didnt find God for another year. And on that day, everything became crystal clear.

50,SDE,1308,41,,F,"After I fell to the ground and my father was with me we chatted like normal, then all of a sudden he said we have to go and see my step-mother and brother. The whole time I experienced this the beautiful warmth and light was upon me, to describe the light as best I can, is like having a massive spotlight place over you and the rim of the light is pure white and protective, inside the light is the perfect warmth, like the temperature is set to perfection. As we walked over to my step-mother I said to her please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know this, I then placed my hand just under her left shoulder and just above her breast and said Dad wants you to know he loves you with all his heart and soul the look on my step-mothers face was shock and tears welled in her eyes. We then walked over to my Brother (who had a 20 yr feud with my sister) I said to him again, please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know, with that I then placed my hand over his stomach, and said Dad understands the feud between he and my sister is deep seated within them and could they please let the past be and find a way to love each other again, my brother was also shocked....I told him again, not to be afraid. After I gave these messages to my family, we walked over to a rose garden, the whole time the light was with me and the most beautiful, euphoric feeling I can not describe was with me. In between the messages I kept repeating to Dad how beautiful it was. When we sat at the rose garden, Dad asked me if there was anything they could do (we werent allowed to tell him during the week he was dying) I said there wasnt the cancer had spread to most of his body and I just kept also repeating Look Dad, look how beautiful it is I was just in awe of it. With that he was gone and I was back to reality. I returned to the motel we were staying at, thinking that the experience was spurred on by lack of sleep or stress. I thought I was losing my mind. Later that day I returned to the Hospital and was in the kitchen when a nurse came in and I told her that I thought I had lost my mind and was it normal when a loved one was dying, I told her about what I had experienced and thinking she would agree that it was stress induced, the nurse (Paula) then stated that is exactly what Dad would experience when he does finally pass. I was shocked. We both returned to Dads room only to find he was awake and outside in the courtyard, with two other nurses beside him. We couldnt believe it. He was telling my brother, as best he could as for most of the week it was hard to make sense out of much he was saying to us, he told my brother he had enough and then looked straight at me and said I have had enough Im ready to go because its beautiful isnt it buttons (a nickname Dad callled me) I was shocked but replied with a smile and said It certainly is Dad. The most wonderful calm came across me and I knew then everything would be alright. Paula (the nurse) then placed her hand on my shoulder and said, There is your confirmation. Later the next day, we all couldnt believe it when my brother and sister were standing in Dads room, hugging each other and genuinely sharing a laugh together. I then softly whispered in Dads ear, See Dad, you did it, I heard you and they are getting along now, everything is ok and you can go now. I know he heard me as I felt a weak grip on my hand as I was holding his hand. A few days later I found out that the messages I had given to my step-mother and brother were almost identical to what my Dad was trying to say the morning I had the experience with my father. I wasnt in the room at the time.

Than there was a situation I wanted to trade my car. So I went to the cardealer and talked to him, there was no reason that I would not have been able to trade in my car. I had money and good credit. But I heard the spirituell conversation again, and there was a headshaking no on my side and the cardealer said ok, I am not able to trade in your car. I wanted to by a cheap place, and there it was again, the no from both places. Everything I my ego wanted to do, I felt like I move against a wall.

53,ME ,1366,34,,F,"I was sitting under a tree and began to think the tree was conscious. Shortly thereafter I felt I was being contacted by my deceased father who said he was worried about the fact that my mother still smoked. (He died of lung cancer in 1981). After a day another entity took my fathers place. He said his name was Thieliel and that he was a Greek scribe who had been captured by the Assyrians and forced into service. I got a flash of him falling to his death from a tower and some pages of strange script. He said that as a suicide he had chosen to spend some time in the afterlife as a guide to prevent the suicide of someone else.  After this encounter, for several days the world seemed to get darker and more threatening, like, physically. My husband wanted to put me in a mental hospital and I feared Id never see my children again.

He smiled, and after standing there for what seemed an eternity, drew his hands from my back, stepped away slowly and faded before my eyes. I immediately arose and went to my desk. For two hours I sat motionless while I recounted vivid memories of the man who had helped a boy whose father was killed when I was eight years old.

Ive always been calm in a crises so I took a few deep breaths to try and relax, hoping that would release my jaw but it didnt work. I remember saying to myself Ill just go back to sleep and itll be all right in the morning. I fell asleep and saw I was in a tunnel which was lit up. I saw ghostly figures at the end of the tunnel beckoning me forward. Just as I got to the end of the tunnel, it began to recede and I was being drawn back to my bed. This upset me and I fought to get to the light but I couldnt. As I left, one of the ghostly figures told me that if I left I couldnt come back, that this was my only chance to go there. When I woke up, the whole experience felt like a dream, including not being able to move my jaw. I soon forgot about it. Years later when I was in my late thirties, I experienced double vision and went for an MRI. The consultant said I was fine, no problems, but that Id had a mini stroke when I was a teenager. It was then I remembered my experience. I told the consultant what had happened to me at the age of 15, (leaving out the spiritual bit) and he said that it definitely sounded like a mini stroke.

58,DEE,1399,51,,M,"I could hear people speaking who were around me, was well aware of my surroundings--I did not expect this visitation to happen. I had said a little prayer (just in case) asking for forgiveness for those I had directly or indirectly hurt, and waited to die--so I thought. I wondered what it would feel like; i.e., would the lights just go out, would it be painful, or what. I could not tell the sex of my visitor, it appeared to clothed in a lovely robe-like material, was very human in appearance, had a lovely smile, appeared gentle and loving and I could see through it. What surprised me most is that it spoke to me without words. The thoughts just jumped into my mind. It knew what I wanted to know just as I had the thought develop in my mind, and I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d Looking back on the experience, that thought makes me smile every time I think about it--it really happened that way. The message was that of love, that it did not matter whether I lived or died--I would be cared for. Finally, the overriding message was, LOVE WAS ALL THAT MATTERED and I did not need to worry. The visitor stayed with me for some time (several minutes) and when I turned to look away, out the cabin window, I could see the lights of a city below. When I turned back, my visitor was gone. In a way, this proved how real the visitation was. It was NO dream. After the plane landed, I was met by an ambulance and taken to Daniel Freeman Hospital. Thinking that I had a Mexican GI upset I was taken to a ward treating GI problems, a nurse noticed that my blood pressure dropped to nearly zero, I was then rushed to a CC unit and placed under the care of a cardiologist, Dr. Ciralo (sp?). There I was diagnosed with severe cardiac dilatation and heart failure, it wasnt until later that a pheochromocytoma was discovered. I was severely hypertensive and apparently this was the cause of my heart failure. When my hypertensive condition was brought under control, my heart returned to normal. This was all documented by ultrasonography and angiography. The pheochromocytoma was removed from my abdomen 1 month later at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. I think back on the experience and still worry about the unknown, but listening to the audio tape of your book has helped restore my faith in the reality of my experience. Thank you!!

69,ME ,1270,29,,F,"In 1974 I was 29 years of age. (I am now 67 years of age.) I was feeling pretty despondent at that time, having spent four years trying to make a living as a visual fine artist in Manhattan but not succeeding. Not knowing how else to support myself, I enlisted in the Army. But as the day of my enlistment grew near, I was becoming increasingly anxious and fearful. I was a free spirit and knew I would hate losing my freedom and someone else telling me what to do. But if I didnt go, I didnt know how else to take care of myself. I did not want to go back to secretarial work, not after I fell in love with art. I was stuck in a tight spot.  Three days before the big day, I was sitting on my hotel bed. I had given up my apartment in Little Italy and took a room for 3 months in a midtown Manhattan hotel. I was just staring out into my room, not knowing which way to turn. It was daytime. With the suddenness of a light switch just turned on, a brilliant white, round glow with a more brilliant Christian cross embedded in the middle of the glow appeared before my eyes. The vision was suspended in mid air. The glow and cross were about ten inches tall and sat about eight feet in front of me, a little lower than my eye level. The light that emanated from the glow was contained. There werent any rays coming from it. The whole cross fit totally within the glow. The cross was a plain, elegant cross with no detail. The ends of the narrow vertical and horizontal bars were cut straight across. (This vision was entirely visual. I didnt feel, smell or hear anything.) Although the glow and cross were as intensely bright as a flame, I stared easily into it. I wasnt afraid by its presence or doubted what was before my eyes. I never said to myself, What is this? or Why is a Christian cross coming to me? I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish. Actually, my mind was blank, without any thoughts. But I was transfixed by this sight, spiritually locked into it. I was aware that the glow and cross were calming me down, making me feel peaceful and serene. I think I was staring at it for a short period of time, maybe 15 minutes.  I remember how the glow and cross came on but I dont remember how it went away. After staring at it, I think I put my head down on a pillow and went to sleep. But the strange thing is that when I awoke, not only wasnt the vision still there but I didnt even remember that I saw it. Actually, I didnt remember this event until 30 years later, when I was sitting in my car experiencing my epiphany, which I talked about in my February 23 submission to you. Looking back at that time, the glow and cross did not tell me if I should go into the Army or not. What this vision did was to calm me down, relax me and relieve me of a paralyzing anxiety which was keeping me from seeing clearly and making the right decision for myself. Relaxed and clear thinking, I made the easy decision to withdraw from my Army enlistment. I went to the Army base and explained how I felt. The female officer there agreed and gave me an honorable discharge.

71,OBE,1552,9,,M,"The dream/experience seems to begin as usual but I started to notice things that I wouldnt normally catch my attention. The first item I recall was looking down at the cloverleaf intersection of the SR55 freeway (we called the Newport freeway even though its officially known as the Costa Mesa freeway) and Interstate 5. It was odd as it seemed as though it was daytime not nighttime. The next commented I made to myself was I could see the top of an apartment building nearby and the air conditioning units on the rooftop. Shortly after that point I felt or sensed something above me. A feeling of warm love and a golden light radiating from above but all around caught my attention. As it did, I slowly ascended towards this wonderful place above me but after a few moment I felt the presence of two beings. I dont seem to recall actually seeing anyone I just felt/knew they were there. There seemed to be something humorous or playful about them I want to say angels but it seems awkward to do so..... Anyway they told me I could not be there and that I had to go back, it was a little disappointing to hear but I didnt feel bad. I agreed after a bit and started to head down and when I felt there attention drift I turned back and headed towards the light. They quickly appeared or I felt them nearby and again they said I had to return. This time I, in the way of a child said, but its so wonderful I dont want too.

75,ME ,1462,23,,M,"Floating in an erect and body as light air: As I was walking, I became aware of a strangely subtle force coming over me. I felt a kind of vibration starting to run up through my body. It was soft at first, then became more pronounced as time went on. I felt the top of my head being pulled straight up while at the same time, my hips were being pulled downward into the earth. It felt as though I was being supported by a bolt of energy that literally ran through my body. The energy expanded from above me and from down below at the same time. My posture became very straight and It felt as though I was floating and weightless within it. I was surprised at how effortless it was to be so light and erect. It reminded me of the description a Tai Chi teacher once gave me of how to stand correctly, as if heaven were pulling me upwards by the top of my head and earth pulling me downwards from somewhere near the prostrate.  Effortless Breathing  Breathing became deep, light and effortless. I found myself witnessing each breath without the experience of guilt or anxiety resisting each in or exhale. All the usual tension in my solar plexus, tightness in my diagram and tension in my lungs had vanished. Breathing became a brand new experience for me, where I was able to take very satisfying and refreshing breaths.I marveled at what was happening to me, It felt wonderful to feel so free and light on the earth in my body. After time it occurred to me that this experience surely couldnt last very long because it felt so wonderful. I waited a while to see if it would leave. I waited for the familiar tension, anxiety, the heaviness of the body and breath to return. After a very short time, I let go and allowed the wonderful experience to guide me. Where did the mind go? As I surrendered more to the experience I became aware that thoughts werent being created on the fly, I had them, but I was creating them when needed and by choice, by powerful choice, they werent free floating and coming out of no where and they certainly werent attacking me. It was like the experiences of floating lightly within my body that had a very erect posture or breathing unburdened by guilt, anxiety, depression, anger, self hatred, self judgement. Now I was experiencing emptiness where 100s of thoughts per seconds should have been. The triad of experiences was connected together and created a sense of great joy, understanding and freedom. Freeing because I had always known myself to be what my thoughts told me I was, and here, those thoughts not existing at all, it was a beautiful realization that I still lived on without them. With the mind being opaque, its opinions laid to rest, the veil of ignorance lifted and laid bare, the truth stood squarely in my face, It was awe inspiring it was beautiful, it was more than joyful. There was no doubt about It. It became clear to me that the mind was not all powerful, all knowing or omnipotent, but rather a mirage that wasnt there when looked at from the side of truth. The truth not only showed what the I was part of, bliss, freedom, love, oneness with all, but at the same time, what I have never been; body, guilty and deserving of punishment, hatred, shame, terror and death. The mind was impotent and could not stand its ground when directly facing the truth. Experiencing truth was the most joyous, romantic and blissful experience. I was free from the slavery of illusion, free to experience the reality of my being, free to love and be loved solely because I was.  How could my past vanish without sins being accounted for? I pondered the implications of how such a ferociously powerful mind grasping into every part of my being every second of my life could have been tossed aside into non existence so matter of faculty. All that I had known myself to be was born out of the abuse and abandonment by my parents. Guilt, anxiety, self hatred, fear\xe2\x80\xa6 they had been my family in the absence of a family, all gone in a flash. How could it be that all sins were forgiven just like that as if thered never been a past me? What did this mean about my reality? Then it occurred to me, for the first time in my life, I was awake. I had never experienced being awake like this. By realizing that I was awake, I could see how I had been dreaming. Truth was showing me that the mind had been lulling me into an non ending dream state with all of its endless thoughts. I had simply awoken from a dream of guilt and shame, terror and death and saw that I had been dreaming. Being able to tell the difference between a dream and being awake is the truth, it is everything, all doubt vanishes. It is easy to tell one has been dreaming when one is awake and therefor no the difference between dreaming and experiencing the truth.

83,SDE,1278,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true.

I said God if you are real please provide me with a bit of faith so that I might believe in you as well.    ,,Citizen,"100,00",religious,religious,Christian,Christian,,,dail,week,avera,moder,"100,000+",maste,I had j,,single,marri,No,average    Q.,All pleasant,adult

95,ME ,1451,24,,M,"Detail may take a bit more space than there is here, but I will attempt. Briefly, very tired, I fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed like the beginning of a dream sequence, I found myself on the second floor of a mansion in town that I was quite personally familiar with. From a spot in the hall, I noticed flashing lights coming from the hallway of the west wing. Irritated and needing to investigate I went in their direction. Where the halls joined at a right angle, still more lights and, of all people, my great aunt staring into the lights at the end of the hall. Very agitated at this occurence, not knowing if it was fire, or some other upset that required my attention, I began a trot in its direction. At that point I recall (kind of like Santas reindeer!) a lifting of my feet and legs and up I went. In very short order all went dark, all fell away (my body, place, circumstances)and the essential me of me was involved in an ascent...until coming to said portal mentioned earlier in which all I can recall were cloudlike formations over a cauldronlike (and that word is not to have any negative connotation) basis...with what was bubbling up from the cauldron mixing in with the clouds above it and this was perfection and creation in action. My KNOWING at that time was that I was in everything, everything was in me, and that everything was in a perfect balance. The other notion I had was that the energy was so powerful that if it were withdrawn everything would collapse, but that that would not happen...furthermore, the word calibrated came to mind. As in, everything was perfectly calibrated to hold only its allotment of that energy, and that one-zillionth more of it and a body would burst into bits. At the portals edge, even though I had no body or even much in the way of caring about what had happened to it, I do recall my hands grabbing the portals edge and I kind of docked there and went no further...only witnessed the roiling of the generator of all that is, was and would be (as described before.) At about the point of docking and peering in, I was conscious, alert, awake and aware, and said to myself: OMG, Im dying! and then something to the effect of I didnt want to do that. (That would be the distressing part and I almost clicked another choice for 42.) As soon as I said that the experience of coming down began, the up there having been short-circuited by my ambivalence or fear...even as I quick-changed my mind and said, No, NO! (leave me up here for a while longer.) The coming down was not so memorable in and of itself. What there is to know is that I did then and still do sleep on my back...and I felt as if my feet were the first to gain life back and then the descent of the rest back down as if my astral back to stomach and like that. As my arms were folded across my chest, they were the last to come to and I recall being conscious of that happening. Upon full re-entry I was quite astonished at the whole thing and lept out of bed as if every cell was on fire and said Holy S**t, Theres nothing I cant do! Later on I went at myself over that notion-thinking that it was a bit egocentric, but I digress. I further recall that everything in the room had a bit of a glow to it, and so probably did I. I also remember being fascinated at a pencil in my room. Its interiority struck me as magnificent...and to think that none of it (me, my body, material circumstances) had mattered or even existed just moments before was quite startling.

96,ME ,1103,20,,M,"As I stood there crying and asking God why he would put me through this I heard a voice. It was not exactly audible, but I heard it in my mind as though it was audible. The statement was very short and concise: You are not alone. That was all. It wasnt booming. It didnt have attending angels or visions, only that one sentence. And yet the reality of it stuck with me. It was not like it hit home or bowled me over. It was just .... true. And nothing else. My grief didnt end, my situation didnt change. The heartbreak continued for months afterwards. However, it made a mark in me that I could not ignore. It is almost as if I could never be naive again about being alone.

97,ADC,1394,49,,F,"Terry Dean                         1946-2012 Terry was a well-known and dedicated musician in the Overberg and Hermanus. Terry\xe2\x80\x99s battle with cancer started in 2007-where it was diagnosed in the colon. He was successfully operated on in September that year and recovered, remaining healthy until March 2009, when a tumour was removed from his small intestine. He received chemotherapy at Tygerberg Hospital afterwards and seemed well. He continued to play his gigs-he said the music took his mind away from the pain. His last gig was just after New Year 2012 at the Shuntin\xe2\x80\x99 Shed in Bot River-but he was very weak by then.  The last six months of his life, he was cared for at home-with the help of Hospice. Terry slipped into a coma on Thursday 28th June-I spoke to him and told him it was alright to move on, that his daughters T&#232;gan and Tullia, and I, would be fine. I also asked him to send me a sign when he crossed over. He passed away in the early hours of Friday morning. He was smiling. I knew he had left us, and in the early winter morning, I looked out of the window up at the grey sky-completely overcast except for a very defined sliver of blue sky- in the perfect shape of an electric guitar. I was so grateful for that sign. Terry had asked a good friend of his to sell his beloved Fender Telecaster (which he bought in America) to help support his family-as he had been unable to work for months. I was told that the lady who bought it was called Tracy; and she had bought it for her partner, John, whom we had never met, as they live near Johannesburg. The morning of Terry\xe2\x80\x99s passing; I received a call from Tracy, enquiring how Terry was. I told her that he had passed away in the early hours of that morning. She gave me condolences and put John on the phone. This is what he told me: On the night in question, at about 11:45 p.m. my very faithful dog, Sasha, nudged me with her nose and would not stop...until I got out of bed. I was at my farm, not far from Hartebeespoort Dam at the time. Only to find Sasha sitting next to the Fender case... I made a cup of coffee, called my dog to the kitchen and she would not budge. I know that it sounds weird, but, I had to play the telecaster... my dog left the room as soon as I plugged the guitar into the amp... played a few bars of John Lee Hooker and went to bed. As you know I phoned you the next morning to offer my condolences... how I knew that?... your Terry was with me, of that I am sure... I feel that he has been back, too often I find myself compelled to play the tele. Bear in mind, I have seven other guitars, all very good... but the tele keeps calling...??? The guitar is well and safe... I play the smoke out of it and love the mood it leaves me with... I am sure you understand what I mean by that. In any case, I have no opinion on the life here after, but, Terry Dean was with me and wanted to hear me play, to see if I was up to scratch, I think?  When John woke up the following morning he said to Tracy, \xe2\x80\x9cTerry\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d    ",,South Afr,1 mill,spiritual,spiritual,Unity,Unity,,,dail,never,avera,avera,"0 24,999",colle,Self-em,,marri,widow,No,average    Q.,All pleasant,adult

105,OBE,1373,39,,F,"I copy here the experience exactly as I typed it then. This records my third experience. The first one occurred in February of 1984 and then August, 1984. The third one in January of 1985, as written.  Jan.26, 1985--it has happened again (On what I experienced in early morning, only half awake). There was a rushing sound, a roaring in my ears. I am half awake now, with consciousness of my surroundings, and also have the feeling I am about to plunge off a cliff, a falling sensation. I feel, just briefly, a sense of immovability--the way in a dream one tries to move and cant, and also a sense of fear arises at this. Then the images begin, the feeling one of plunging deep into a vortex, but everything is vividly clear, in color. The images are against a black background, and they are perfect crystalline forms, changing constantly, that make me think of snowflake forms at times, then of those theoretical models of chemical components or DNA, and then of pure rock crystal forms. The speed of the images is way beyond me, their transformations occurring without cessation. Nothing exists but this silent world I seem to have entered, as the forms recede and accelerate alternately in the darkness. Then they stop--disappear, and what I see at a vast distance in total blackness, as if I were looking through a telescope backwards, only infinitely smaller than that, is a tiny circle of light. I see it as if I am looking into a cauldron of light, barely glimpsed at such a distance, but it shifts and flickers on the edges. Only a tiny part of it is revealed to me, but the light is so clear it is like the interior of a diamond--a dazzling light, that oddly conveys a sense, for which I cannot account, that it has a knowledge of some sort--as if the light was source. Then a tingling feeling occurs and the image ends--it all goes away, and I sense my regular surroundings again. I try to go to sleep. The first time this happened, last February 84, I was scared silly.  The images occurred after I experienced the same roaring sound, but at that time (also an early hour, between 2 and 5 a.m.) there was also a loud cracking sound; in fact, that happened first. The images were, then, not immediately visible. They appeared finally in the center of a deep blackness at a great distance in a curling, churning fire of light, and accelerated toward me until I could see the swirling changing crystal forms. I stayed up an hour afterwards, writing it down. I felt then the same tingling sensation at the onset and end of the event, and the same moment of immovability. The second time (all told, it has happened three times) was last summer, August, 84. And now this one, around 4:30 or 5 a.m. The fear was briefer; I knew more of what to expect, and it was as if I willed myself to hold on. I had been asleep, wake up to the buzzing, electric sensation, and the rest, and then it begins. I let the images come. In the times between the 3 events Ive tried to make it happen, unsuccessfully. Each time has occurred only spontaneously. Each time I feel I have encountered something with great energy or power within it. I feel it will happen again--that there is more to learn. Especially within that light. It frightens me, yet I sense it has meaning, validity. I wonder at its meaning, and seek it out.

109,DEE,1542,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

110,DEE,1299,22,,M,"I entered my bedroom, sat down on a cushioned window seat, and the sobbing continued. Moments later, I felt a tingling in my arms, kind of like they had fallen asleep, though I wasnt sitting in a way that impaired blood flow. Moments later, my arms rose from my sides and my hands literally came together in prayer in front of my chest. I watched in complete wonderment as this occurred. And I suddenly felt in my heart a very clear instruction that I needed to get on my knees and pray. But I was refused. I didnt understand why prayer was necessary. In fact, it seemed like an act of subservience that made me uneasy. Meanwhile, my arms and hands were literally vibrating, and my hands were stuck together that literally, I was unable to pull them apart. Why is this happening to me, I wondered. And I suddenly understood that I was dying. No sooner did that thought cross my mind, my hands fell back to my sides--thus making a connection in my mind between the thought I was dying and the release of my hands from the unseen force, and the immediate cessation of the tingling sensations. Given how strange this all was, it seemed perfectly logical to me that I was indeed dying. My mother was spiritual, so I thought I better go downstairs and tell her. In the living room, I sat beside my mother and told her what had just happened. She told me to go ahead and pray. I told her I couldnt, and that I was dying. She was very spiritual. When she heard this, she thought perhaps a part of me was dying, to make room for something else... but I wasnt physically dying. I told her she was wrong. She checked my temperature. I had a fever of 103. She went to get some aspirin, and told me to to relax. After I took the aspirin, I lay down on the living room couch, and thats when a spiritual being showed up. I heard him as clear as day, talking in my head, just as if he was in the room with me. The first thing he said to me was, Ok, lets go! When he said that, I could feel a pulling sensation all of a sudden on the region of my solar plexus. If the soul was real, it felt like he was reaching in and pulling my soul out of my body. It was a very uncomfortable and unusual feeling, and I reacted to it by kicking my feet on the couch. When I did this, the pulling, or suction-y feeling stopped. Long story short, this fight to stay went on for more than an hour. I remained lucid throughout the whole experience, conversing with my family while also telepathically conversing with this Being. The longer I resisted, the more this Being resorted to threatening me. I didnt care--no matter what the threats (Stay and youll be crazy, no one will ever understand you, your family wont remember a thing--their memories will be wiped) I refused to go wherever it was this Being was intent on taking me. Finally, fed up with my refusal, the Being told me he wasnt leaving empty handed. If I didnt come then and there, he would cause my father to have a massive heart attack, and he would take my father. My father and I had had a long and stormy relationship, however, I didnt have to think about that threat. I immediately relented and agreed to come. But I asked to say goodbye to my family first--which he permitted. I literally kissed and hugged everyone who was there and said goodbye. It was the saddest moment I have ever experienced. Then I told the Being I was finally ready, and I heard a voice (a different voice than the Being) tell me it wasnt my time. For a while I pleaded to go. I was ready. But it was no use. My fever broke, and I felt better than I had ever felt in my life-- and I appreciated my life like I had never appreciated it before.

My eyes are healthy and I only wear glasses for driving and very close work. They are tested regularly. The triangles lasted around 20 minutes and my husband saw only my aura which he said was silver. He could feel something but could not be specific. I sat in meditation and opened chakras. I feel that what I received was some affirmation that my spiritual pathway is on the right lines and my progress was moving forwards.

118,ME ,1462,23,,M,"Floating in an erect and body as light air: As I was walking, I became aware of a strangely subtle force coming over me. I felt a kind of vibration starting to run up through my body. It was soft at first, then became more pronounced as time went on. I felt the top of my head being pulled straight up while at the same time, my hips were being pulled downward into the earth. It felt as though I was being supported by a bolt of energy that literally ran through my body. The energy expanded from above me and from down below at the same time. My posture became very straight and It felt as though I was floating and weightless within it. I was surprised at how effortless it was to be so light and erect. It reminded me of the description a Tai Chi teacher once gave me of how to stand correctly, as if heaven were pulling me upwards by the top of my head and earth pulling me downwards from somewhere near the prostrate.  Effortless Breathing  Breathing became deep, light and effortless. I found myself witnessing each breath without the experience of guilt or anxiety resisting each in or exhale. All the usual tension in my solar plexus, tightness in my diagram and tension in my lungs had vanished. Breathing became a brand new experience for me, where I was able to take very satisfying and refreshing breaths.I marveled at what was happening to me, It felt wonderful to feel so free and light on the earth in my body. After time it occurred to me that this experience surely couldnt last very long because it felt so wonderful. I waited a while to see if it would leave. I waited for the familiar tension, anxiety, the heaviness of the body and breath to return. After a very short time, I let go and allowed the wonderful experience to guide me. Where did the mind go? As I surrendered more to the experience I became aware that thoughts werent being created on the fly, I had them, but I was creating them when needed and by choice, by powerful choice, they werent free floating and coming out of no where and they certainly werent attacking me. It was like the experiences of floating lightly within my body that had a very erect posture or breathing unburdened by guilt, anxiety, depression, anger, self hatred, self judgement. Now I was experiencing emptiness where 100s of thoughts per seconds should have been. The triad of experiences was connected together and created a sense of great joy, understanding and freedom. Freeing because I had always known myself to be what my thoughts told me I was, and here, those thoughts not existing at all, it was a beautiful realization that I still lived on without them. With the mind being opaque, its opinions laid to rest, the veil of ignorance lifted and laid bare, the truth stood squarely in my face, It was awe inspiring it was beautiful, it was more than joyful. There was no doubt about It. It became clear to me that the mind was not all powerful, all knowing or omnipotent, but rather a mirage that wasnt there when looked at from the side of truth. The truth not only showed what the I was part of, bliss, freedom, love, oneness with all, but at the same time, what I have never been; body, guilty and deserving of punishment, hatred, shame, terror and death. The mind was impotent and could not stand its ground when directly facing the truth. Experiencing truth was the most joyous, romantic and blissful experience. I was free from the slavery of illusion, free to experience the reality of my being, free to love and be loved solely because I was.  How could my past vanish without sins being accounted for? I pondered the implications of how such a ferociously powerful mind grasping into every part of my being every second of my life could have been tossed aside into non existence so matter of faculty. All that I had known myself to be was born out of the abuse and abandonment by my parents. Guilt, anxiety, self hatred, fear\xe2\x80\xa6 they had been my family in the absence of a family, all gone in a flash. How could it be that all sins were forgiven just like that as if thered never been a past me? What did this mean about my reality? Then it occurred to me, for the first time in my life, I was awake. I had never experienced being awake like this. By realizing that I was awake, I could see how I had been dreaming. Truth was showing me that the mind had been lulling me into an non ending dream state with all of its endless thoughts. I had simply awoken from a dream of guilt and shame, terror and death and saw that I had been dreaming. Being able to tell the difference between a dream and being awake is the truth, it is everything, all doubt vanishes. It is easy to tell one has been dreaming when one is awake and therefor no the difference between dreaming and experiencing the truth.

120,DEE,1503,42,,M,I had decided to do the plant based medicine Ibogaine HCL from Africa at my home with two friends present who were helpers and care givers if required. After taking Ibogaine 18.5 milligrams I began to feel dizzy and went and laid in my bed. Lights were off and all windows were darkened. I was semi sat up in bed with eyes wide open the whole experience. Post two hrs I began seeing light of all colours pour through my ceiling and into my room. I felt at the last point my body being raised and a sense of lightness. About 30 mins after all color had stopped flowing into my room where everything became kinda pixelated. I could see energy like dust particles clearly and then I could see masses of energy which quickly became vivid people in spirit. I could continue to see spirits seven in all and spiders and a big bull frog up until dusk. This the ibogaine wore off and everyone slowly disappeared again.

124,NDE,1138,34,,F,"As I pondered my situation, I slowly became aware of overwhelming feelings of peace, love, acceptance, and certain knowledge of perfection and purpose. I felt great awe. It quickly became clear to me that the light was the ultimate intellect, love, and creative force. The psychological environment in which I now existed literally permeated around and through me. I knew that Light knew my every nuance, every thought, and every deed. Amazingly, it still loved me, even viewed me with a certain sense of delighted humor. In an odd way the Light was part of me. Yet it was also everything else. As I easily, and happily, settled into this new environment I realized that time and space were very different than what I was used to. I could follow multiple trains of thought and experience in what seemed to be a simultaneous manner. It was akin to how we use time in dreams in that numerous situations were playing out in \xe2\x80\x98no time\xe2\x80\x99. I was luxuriating in the perfection of the situation, while simultaneously making mental notes of my surroundings. At the same time, Light was addressing me thru telepathy and instilling within me what I later called scrolls of knowledge. These scrolls unraveled and revealed information about the true nature of reality. I think that the figurative scrolls were thought forms that existed within Light and Light was mentally pushing them onto my consciousness. I had no idea what they meant, as the ideas and knowledge contained within was light years more complex than I could grasp. I sensed the periphery and intent of the scrolls and knew that it would take eternity to sort it all out. Still, the bit I could sort out made it clear that in the physical dimension we are capable of experience far beyond what we ever imagined. Prior to the NDE I had experienced three enormously frightening out-of-bodies. Frightening because I \xe2\x80\x98caught myself\xe2\x80\x99 in the upper corner of the ceiling, watching myself sleep on each occasion. I did not know what was happening. I had never heard of an out-of-body experience. Now I knew, clearly, that the out-of-bodies were normal, and just the tip of the iceberg of what humans could and should experience. I received, thru telepathically transmitted images and thoughts, a glimpse of the fully developed multi-dimensional being. As I floated within Light, numerous paths of information were being delivered to me. I felt peaceful, and perfect. Suddenly I heard a deep male voice say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go back?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBack?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cback to where?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to go back, concentrate on that noise\xe2\x80\x9d, it said. My thought was NO; I do not want to go anywhere! The thought of leaving this new, yet strangely familiar, environment seemed a travesty. Still for some reason I turned my attention slightly to the left. Far away, as if thru a long train tunnel, I heard a faint noise. As I listened more intently, it got louder. I realized it was my beloved husband Ed. He was screaming my name. The next thing I knew, I was coming to consciousness in my bed. After returning to physicality I felt very lethargic and drifted off to sleep. The NDE remained clear in my mind. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it was, having never heard of an NDE, but I knew it was real. The next day Ed phoned me at work and said he had scheduled an appointment with my doctor, and was coming over to take me to it. At the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office he said I had been having some sort of seizure that did not involve convulsions. It was more like a dead person. He said my body had seized up like it was frozen and my eyes had rolled back in my head. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me until now, as he did not want to scare me. I thought I had just lost consciousness.

128,ADC,1144,57,,M,"Now, I must say that it is not completely uncommon to see deer in our yard although, for whatever reason, I hadnt seen any for a few months. I work from home and have a large window next to my desk that looks out over our back yard. I asked Christine to send deer because I felt it would be solid confirmation if, on the very day I asked to see deer, it actually happened. Unfortunately, on this particular day I was so consumed with work that I dont even remember looking out my window. By the time I realized it was already dark outside, I also realized I never saw any deer. I was terribly disappointed with myself that I hadnt come up for air all day. Did Christine send the deer and I missed the signal to look up and out the window? Or did she not hear my plea? Maybe Im making this all up after all. I have been working on my computer moving very large files around and so before going upstairs for dinner with my wife (Christines mom), I begin a disk compression operation that takes a significant amount of time. I click the start button and go to dinner.  After dinner I came back downstairs to see the progress for my disk compression. Its going very slowly. To pass some time I start poking around on one of the other hard drives to see whats on it. I come across an obscurely named folder I havent seen for a while called My Pictures (GoFlex1TB)\\Canon60D NotSaved.

131,OBE,1341,66,,F,"I decided to take a Past-Life Workshop in the small, homey office of a hypnotist in Katonah, New York last year. Besides the hypnotist, another woman and myself were present. Before the session started, the pleasant hypnotist explained that she was going to hypnotize us. (I tried hypnosis one other time in my life but I couldnt be hypnotized. I thought, however, that I would try it again.) She said we would be going down a long flight of stairs. As we went down, we would be getting more and more tired. When we reached the bottom of the stairs, we would be hypnotized. Then she would direct us to go into a room where we would see who we were and where we were in our past life. It all sounded pretty okay, nothing scary. So, sitting in comfortable chairs, we closed our eyes and the leader directed us down a long flight of stairs. I remember the stairway was dark, but not frightening, and I was getting more and more tired. At the bottom of the stairs, she told us to open the door in front of us and go into the room but I saw a window opened and I flew out instead. I flew out into the dark universe. I wasnt in a spacecraft, it was just me flying. I remember just flying around in the darkness but not feeling afraid. I have a sensation that I was a young woman then, not my senior age at the time of this STE. I never actually heard anything. My experience was silent. I dont remember feeling cold or hot, but just right. I was wearing an ordinary set of clothes--pants and a top. I remember loving the experience of flying. I felt peaceful, serene and happy. I was flying alone, although I have a sense that my husband, Hank, was there from time to time. I remember seeing faraway stars and planets but I didnt land on anything. I was in heaven, in more ways than one. At some point I became aware that I was struggling to do something--waking up. I didnt want to leave the universe, I was enjoying flying so much, but I was awakening to my present human reality in the hypnotists office. When I awoke, the other woman was already awake. The hypnotist asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said I was having a hard time waking up. She thought I fell asleep but I told her I wasnt sleeping. The other woman talked about her experience and then I talked about my flying experience. The woman and hypnotist didnt say anything while I was describing my OBE. The session ended pretty much there. I remember feeling strange about being in this strange world on Earth. I wasnt sure I was okay enough to go out into the street and drive my car home, but I was. I can still feel myself flying in the dark universe, feeling peaceful and happy.

132,OBE,1142,27,,F,"I suddenly found myself out of my body looking at myself on the couch sleeping, I walked around the apartment and kept referring back to myself on the couch just to check for security for some reason it was comforting to know I was there even if I wasnt completely inside of myself any longer. I went into the bathroom in this spirit form and saw a great statue perched on the closed toilet seat that looked like a statue but I didnt realize it was the angel of death but either way I didnt feel any fear from it. I saw some mini creatures that were about 2-3 feet in size going into the drain of the bathtub happily and willingly and as the approached the drain they would spin as if being flushed and I could see this great release on their faces and wanted to experience that same release too. So I decided to follow them and the moment I willingly resigned my soul for it to be permitted to be flushed down the bathtub drain I felt for the first time complete separation of myself from something that had always been with me but because I had never been without it I didnt know I had always had it...that was this connection to God. It was only in that vortex that I immediately knew I had made a mistake by stepping into that bathtub drain and called out to God and asked him to take me back to my body on the couch over and over but the tunnel vortex thing I was in spinning inside of and going deeper felt so isolated and I felt so alone and felt that my pleading and cries couldnt even be heard from God. Then the angel I had seen perched on top of the toilet next to the bathtub swooped down and caught me as I was decending in the vortex and I began to justify myself to God asking why would you permit the angel of death to personally escort me to Hell I am not a bad person?

137,DEE,1158,9,,M,"As the night passed I would fall into and out of sleep, waking when I became cold with chills or hot from the fever. At one point during the night I had awoken again from the fever and at that time I became more aware that my illness was worse, much worse than my parents had originally thought. I definitely dont believe my parents were aware of just how ill I was because had they know they would have taken me to a doctor. At this point when I awoke from the fever I was delirious again and wanted to get up and wake my parents to tell them how sick I was but I didnt have the strength to get up or yell for them. I was very distressed by this time as I just intuitively knew I was very ill and I needed help, but was helpless as I could not speak let alone get up to tell my parents.

138,ADC,1173,34,,F,"Sunday morning at a local antique car show with my family I was overcome by a message in my head from a grandmotherly voice. You can eat less, you will still be fed. You dont have to fear not being fed, it is a different time now. I knew pretty quickly that the message was for the intuitive. However, I did not want to pass on the message. As a psychiatrist I was keenly aware that such a message could be exceedingly destructive to a person with a history of an eating disorder. I resisted the STE...this only made the message louder and more difficult to ignore. It repeated not only in my head but in my body, insistent. I felt myself becoming rapidly ill. My body ached as though I had the flu. Within 30 minutes I had to leave my family at the antique care show and go home. At home I tried vainly to ignore the pounding message and sleep to no avail. Finally in desperation I said aloud okay, already, Ill tell her. I sent the intuitive an email explaining the situation and while I had extreme doubts about the social moire and the professional impropriety of my action, as soon as I sent the email I was flooded with relief. The flu-like symptoms and the message vanished. I crawled to bed and slept deeply for several hours until my family returned (as I have never done before.) It was several days before the intuitive finally contacted me and told me that she had prayed to her grandmother the friday before I met her asking desperately for help with her weight gain. The intuitive was perplexed that she normally receives insights for her clients, yet here was a straight-laced ivy league educated physician being contacted by her grandmother with literally the answer to her prayers. When I saw the same intuitive two years later for a brief ten minutes, she revealed that the message had quite literally changed her life. Specifically she had been able to return to her typical body weight easily and without dieting and maintained it for the intervening time.

139,DEE,1028,19,,F,"I was visiting a Bahai temple that was completely white without adornment. I approached what appeared to be a window but when I stood in front of the window of the temple which was very large and arched and without glass or panes, the space beyond the window was a turquoise blue light that radiated life, energy, and unconditional love. I was so transfixed by the experience that I could not move. The communication about the love was powerful and washed over me like a torrent. I was reduced to nothingness...I understood that my decision to become a Bahai was part of the reason I was having this expereince. Gradually the light faded away and I was brought back to the physical reality of the temple and the presence of my mother. She was remarking on the beauty of the archictecture of the building and I understood that she would not likely be able to experience what I had just experienced.

My brother said to me loudly check the baby. I just thought I was having an emotional feeling and ignored it. Again he said louder check the baby, again I ignored it thinking I was crazy from his death. A third time he said very very loudy CHECK THE BABY. I could not ignore it so I got up to check my newborn and she was BLUE. I shook her and she did not breath. I shook her again and she still did not breath. Then I remembered reading in a Respiratory Therapy book (my profession) that to get a baby to gasp you only had to pinch their feet. I pinched her foot and she gasped. I totally freaked out and picked up the baby and drove to my parents house to tell them my experience. They believed my without question. I went to my place of employment to pick up an apnea monitor (again, my profession). My baby never had any other episodes of apnea.

141,NDA,1047,35,,M,"She was very weak, had stopped eating and couldnt swallow even an eyedropper of water. She slipped back and forth between consciousness and being non-responsive. the event began casually enough, with her periodically asking Who is that person across the room. Hospice warned me this could happen. Of course I would look and no one was there so I would say I dont know. After a couple more times of mentioning that people were standing across the room, they became closer. At one point, she saw 2 people standing right next to my sister at her bedside. My mom asked my sister Who is that? My sister asked Where? and my mom said Right beside you! Of course that totally creeped out my sister! Keep in mind that although Hospice had given her morphine which I was to deliver as needed, after the first and only time I gave it to my mom, after a few hours she woke up and asked me what I had given her. I told her morphine for the pain. She said They told me Im not supposed to take it so please dont give it to me again. I did not. So the incidents of her seeing people were becoming more frequent and she mentioned a Benjamin which my father said must have been one of her favorite distant relatives that had passed on well before I was born. He said my mother always had a connection with Benjamin in life and that they were good friends. She also saw both her parents and would carry on conversations with them. I would sit by her bedside, holding her hand and she would seem unresponsive yet mumbling as if she was talking to someone. At one point, she was talking to her deceased father, I guess, because my dad and I kept hearing the occasional Daddy come out of her mouth. All of a sudden her eyes would open and she would look directly at me and ask Can you please tell Daddy (or Aline her mother) to come back? I want to talk to them again. One morning, she asked me to go get my father, which I did. She said to him Joe I love you. He said I love you too. She said I dont know whether to LET them help me leave. (We knew she meant her parents and the others she had been talking to). My father asked If you went with them, would you be happy? She said OH YES! Then he said Well, then, you should go. Sometime after that point, they told her what time she would be departing. 1:30. We didnt know whether that meant AM or PM but her demeanor was one of anticipation. She was almost excited. She kept asking (felt like every 5 minutes) What time is it? What time is it now? What about now? Despite our grief, we had to chuckle at her reaction. After that, the next day the chaplin was scheduled to visit at 9:30 am. He called at 9:00 am to say he would be delayed. He told me he would be able to get there at 1;30 pm. the coincidence totally escaped me at that time. I walked into the bedroom and my mom perked up and asked Who was on the phone? (which by the way is really out-of-character for someone who is in a non-responsive state almost 24/7. At that point, she didnt even act as though she knew she was in her own bedroom). I told her it was the chaplin and that he would be there at 1:30 pm. She exclaimed HOW DOES HE KNOW? I had to laugh! I told her He doesnt think you are going to die at 1:30! Hes just late! (little did I know!) So, fast-forward to 1:00 pm. Tracy, the aide was with my mom and I had gone down to my house to bathe and change clothes. A very strong thought popped into my head GET DOWN THERE! I looked at the clock and it was 1:15 pm. My only thought at that point was that I didnt want to miss the chaplin. I ran down the street and met him on the sidewalk as he was leaving. After a brief exchange, I hurried into the bedroom whereby Tracy promptly grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me into the bathroom. Wide-eyed she said I just saw something! Ive never seen anything! I just saw a BIRD fly into your mothers hospital gown! It flew inside the fabric! I saw the gown billow up as it flew across her heart. Then it disappeared! I was speechless. I said come on! and we went back into the room. My mother was having trouble breathing and her lips where turning blue. I looked and Tracy and said this is it, isnt it? Very quickly, my moms skin flashed blue (anoxia?) yellow (jaundice?) then pink/grey again almost like technicolor and at the same time I could hear her lungs filling up with fluid very quickly. No longer able to take a breath, she quickly expired. It was 1:30 pm.

It seemed both immediate and eternal, at the same time. I didnt pay much attention to the potential consequences, at the time of the accident.

143,ME ,1302,51,,F,"Sometime in 1996, I was sitting alone in my office in my home in the middle of writing my memoir novel. I was sitting in my chair, thinking at the time. Suddenly I saw a vision in my head that Im entitling Our Human Timeline of Existence. It was a horizontally long image running left to right in my head. There were no words, numbers or sounds, only images. At the left of this horizontal Timeline was the first image. That image was of an ape down on all fours and facing left. To the right of that ape and facing right was a second ape starting to stand up. To the right of that ape and facing right was the third ape, looking Neanderthal. To the right of that ape was a picture of a human being facing right. Then there was a little space. To the right of the space was the image of Leonardo da Vinci\xe2\x80\x99s Vitruvian Man. To the right of that was a very, very long empty area. At the right end of the Timeline, the last image, is a great gust of horizontal wind blurring out the whole right end of the Timeline. That was what I saw. There were no dates on this Timeline. I thought about that vision and why I was seeing it. According to the spacing of the images one to another on the left and then the very long empty space in the middle area and then the wind blur all the way on the right, the vision said to me that, according to where Vitruvian Man was standing in the Timeline, we humans are currently (the 20th Century) into about 20% of our survival, from our beginnings on Earth to our end. I couldnt see our end because that was where the horizontal wind blur was, which took up all the space on the right side. There were no dates, so I dont know how it would happen to us, when, or if it would even happen at all. What I do see is that we humans have many, many more millenniums of survival. I believe I saw this vision and I believe (kinda) in what it was telling me. I wasnt sure what I was supposed to do with this knowledge except to tell people. But since that was one of my first spiritual experiences, I was so new to God (but still an atheist), that I think I told one other person. I wasnt confident in what I saw and I didnt want people to think I was crazy. Im uploading a file of the picture I drew of this vision. I dont remember what day I actually saw it because I wasnt writing down my spiritual experiences yet. So I recorded my vision in this picture at a later time, June 19, 2006.

144,ME ,1451,24,,M,"Detail may take a bit more space than there is here, but I will attempt. Briefly, very tired, I fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed like the beginning of a dream sequence, I found myself on the second floor of a mansion in town that I was quite personally familiar with. From a spot in the hall, I noticed flashing lights coming from the hallway of the west wing. Irritated and needing to investigate I went in their direction. Where the halls joined at a right angle, still more lights and, of all people, my great aunt staring into the lights at the end of the hall. Very agitated at this occurence, not knowing if it was fire, or some other upset that required my attention, I began a trot in its direction. At that point I recall (kind of like Santas reindeer!) a lifting of my feet and legs and up I went. In very short order all went dark, all fell away (my body, place, circumstances)and the essential me of me was involved in an ascent...until coming to said portal mentioned earlier in which all I can recall were cloudlike formations over a cauldronlike (and that word is not to have any negative connotation) basis...with what was bubbling up from the cauldron mixing in with the clouds above it and this was perfection and creation in action. My KNOWING at that time was that I was in everything, everything was in me, and that everything was in a perfect balance. The other notion I had was that the energy was so powerful that if it were withdrawn everything would collapse, but that that would not happen...furthermore, the word calibrated came to mind. As in, everything was perfectly calibrated to hold only its allotment of that energy, and that one-zillionth more of it and a body would burst into bits. At the portals edge, even though I had no body or even much in the way of caring about what had happened to it, I do recall my hands grabbing the portals edge and I kind of docked there and went no further...only witnessed the roiling of the generator of all that is, was and would be (as described before.) At about the point of docking and peering in, I was conscious, alert, awake and aware, and said to myself: OMG, Im dying! and then something to the effect of I didnt want to do that. (That would be the distressing part and I almost clicked another choice for 42.) As soon as I said that the experience of coming down began, the up there having been short-circuited by my ambivalence or fear...even as I quick-changed my mind and said, No, NO! (leave me up here for a while longer.) The coming down was not so memorable in and of itself. What there is to know is that I did then and still do sleep on my back...and I felt as if my feet were the first to gain life back and then the descent of the rest back down as if my astral back to stomach and like that. As my arms were folded across my chest, they were the last to come to and I recall being conscious of that happening. Upon full re-entry I was quite astonished at the whole thing and lept out of bed as if every cell was on fire and said Holy S**t, Theres nothing I cant do! Later on I went at myself over that notion-thinking that it was a bit egocentric, but I digress. I further recall that everything in the room had a bit of a glow to it, and so probably did I. I also remember being fascinated at a pencil in my room. Its interiority struck me as magnificent...and to think that none of it (me, my body, material circumstances) had mattered or even existed just moments before was quite startling.

145,DEE,1542,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

148,DEE,1205,45,,F,"Well it has been a few years, but here is what happened. I was at Mass. We attend weekly. This week, for some reason, my eyes kept being drawn towards the rafters above the altar. I kept feeling a presence, actually two, playfully going from rafter to rafter. Ive felt presences before, never at church. Whenever I do, I usually just ignore, or if it is strong enough, tell it to call on the name of Christ. So the feeling kept getting stronger and stronger, I finally stated silently for the things to play quieter so I could concentrate on the Mass. They didnt leave though. And we lined up for the Holy Eucharist, and I received the Body of Christ from Rita, a long time parishoner and dedicated Eucharistic minister. As soon as she gave the Host to me, I didnt even get to walk to my seat when I heard a loud CRASH! The silver bowl witht the Host was dropped because Rita collapsed and died on the spot. As soon as that happened, I slowly felt the presences leave. Come to find out about a week later at Ritas funeral, that she used to be a nun, she was in love with the Eucharist, and her life-long wish was to die IN THE CHURCH, GIVING OUT THE EUCHARIST. Those angels in the rafters (or whatever celestial beings they were) were there for Rita. I only observed, or felt their presence. This isnt the first time Ive felt unearthly presences, but most definitely the strongest. You can check on Ritas death if you want to confirm this, just let me know and I will give you the name of the parish and the presiding priest. Please keep me nameless, for now. Thank you.

178,OBE,1392,22,,M,"This story is an account of an amazing venture into the future that came about by what I, years later, came to know as a Near Death Experience. Although I wasnt physically near death at the time, I experienced all the earmarks of a classic Near Death Experience, including leaving my physical body and traveling at tremendous speeds through a variety of mystical dimensions.   A Window in Time By Joe   The cold March rain dripped steadily off the back porch awning as I ran water for my morning coffee. Through the kitchen window I could see streaks of snow across the muddy back yard. Where the yard ended and the dark gray bark of maple trees along the hillside took over, the snow still covered all the land. The phone rang. Setting down the coffee pot, I reached for the phone. Hello. I said. You wanna meet for lunch? Jim asked without even bothering to say hello. Sure, I replied. Anything to get me out and away from the boredom. We exchanged a few more words and hung up. I put the coffee pot on the stove, grabbed a quick shower, put on a sweatshirt, poured myself a cup of coffee, and sat down to read a couple chapters from an Eric Von Daniken book I had just picked up the day before. A couple hours later, I put on a rainproof windbreaker and headed for town. When I arrived at Charlies Lounge, Jim was already there. Whats the special?, I asked the bartender.  Burger and fries, he said. Good enough for me, I replied. Put some cheese on it too. Jim looked over and smiled. You wanna beer? Ah, its a little early for that I said. Come on, one with lunch wont hurt you. he said. Get him a draught, he said to the bartender. Jim was a road construction worker who hadnt been working for the past couple weeks due to the incessant rain. Id known him since we were kids. His boredom wasnt as intense as mine, but the cold, dreary rain was getting a lot of people down in this tiny Pennsylvania railroad town. It was a tough little town along the edge of the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania. The heart of Appalachia was just a few minutes away. The Vietnam War was just winding down and Watergate was front page news every day. Life, like the weather, was bleak. A month earlier I had finished a two year stint as a Military Policeman in Germany.  I was accustomed to the excitement of constant stimulation. As a policeman I had weathered the drama and tragedy of the Munich Olympics, witnessed first hand the violence of the militant Baader-Meinhof Gang, and while wearing the white hat of law enforcement, had been front and center in the unpredictable and dangerous world of heroin addiction. Okay, Ill sip on a beer, I said to the bartender. Jim smiled. When I looked in his direction I could see a couple guys playing a game of pool. Immediately my radar went off. Two brothers were playing a game of eightball. One of the brothers was a year older than me, and had been a superb football player. The other brother was a year younger than me and had always been a bit of a troublemaker. And, he was drunk! It just past noon and he was drunker than a skunk. Several years earlier, I had been in an all out fight with the younger one. I had knocked him down and was on top of him, pounding the living daylights out of him when someone pulled me off.  Here he was again. Drunk, and this time with his older brother, who it appeared he was going to try and impress. He was staring at me. His face was getting red. I could feel my adrenalin surging. Every drop of testosterone in my body was lit up. The two years in the military had added 30 pounds of muscle to my body. I had been trained in judo and self defense techniques. I was capable of putting anyone into submission in seconds. I was ready! To avoid initiating any confrontation and to maintain my focus, I chose to gaze at the cue ball(the all white pool ball) as it bounded around the pool table. A moment went by, then two. I kept my focus on the cue ball. I began developing a slightly different mind set. I clearly remembering saying to myself, I choose to not allow my emotions to dictate my actions. I choose to just stay focused on the neutral cue ball. Then BOOM, it happened. Suddenly, without warning, my entire state of consciousness shot directly out of the top of my head. Everything I knew to be me was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and accelerating by the second. At first I seemed to have shot through a tunnel like zone, then into a brightly lit world. I went past cities, land masses, continents, entire worlds. and universes. I clearly remember seeing a great River. I remember thinking at the time that it must be the River that St John spoke of in Revelations. I remember clearly because, at the time, I was a dyed in the wool atheist. But I didnt stop there.

After years of searching for my life purpose it was handed to me on a plate, quite literally from the Universe straight into my head, like a light bulb suddenly being switched on in a deep dark cave of confusion. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t lose me here, you may be thinking: \xe2\x80\x98so who are you and what do you know about re-evaluating the conceptual framework around mental illness or achieving universal peace?\xe2\x80\x99 That is exactly what I thought when the information came to me; I am no Professor or academic guru. That is the point, this has nothing to do with who I am, I have been given this message to prove that anybody of any intellect or social standing can tap into the psychic realm and see a universal truth; all you have to do is ask the question and then believe in the answer.  I have been told by spirit that the mental health system in our Western society desperately needs modifying in terms of spiritual experience. Mental distress is actually a fallacy of modern society which is ever increasing in line with consumerism and will continue to do so unless we acknowledge the problems we are creating. We must see mental distress of any kind with new eyes if human evolution is going to continue in the way it is meant. Mental distress originates in fear, a fear lodged in our past that we carry with us into the present, and project into the future, a destructive fear from which we can be free, individually, and so, universally. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s the irony:My fear of speaking out about this message and how it came to me \xe2\x80\x93 the message that it is fear that stops mankind achieving mental wellbeing, happiness and fundamentally Universal peace \xe2\x80\x93 nearly stopped me from following my path, after years of searching! I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that I\xe2\x80\x99m not still scared, but what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were to tell everyone they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be scared, if I were too afraid to put my head above the parapet and risk being shot at? Before I had my \xe2\x80\x98experience\xe2\x80\x99 I knew nothing about spirituality, and even less about religion. So what happened was as incredulous to me as what you are going to read may sound to you! I have, however, always had good intuition and a kind of underlying \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 since childhood that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching for something that was missing, like I always knew there was another dimension even though society and my education told me otherwise. I was about 12 when I read the book \xe2\x80\x98Utopia\xe2\x80\x99 and to me it was more than just fiction, it was a possibility. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t just think it\xe2\x80\x99s achievable; I know how. It all happened when I had started to meditate at the same time as thinking more deeply about what to be \xe2\x80\x98mentally ill\xe2\x80\x99 actually means. I\xe2\x80\x99d worked within the field for long enough to know about academic theory; the nature / nurture argument and chemical imbalances. What was the truth? I started to question my own sanity, I have always been very sensitive and emotional; where do you draw the line? I am well aware that by writing this, that by voicing my beliefs that I have channelled a message from the spiritual realm, I could be seen by some working within the mental health field as being deluded or having experienced a psychotic episode. You may choose to believe that this is the rambling of an unstable mind, you may suggest that what I am saying is insane. I, however, now know that the real insanity would be for me to ignore such an important message. If I were to ignore it and deny myself my truth for fear of speaking out against a system, I know that I would become mentally distressed \xe2\x80\x93 and that is also proof enough for me to know that the message I have been given is the truth. Many people who try to speak out about their psychic experiences are told that what they are experiencing is not real; that they are \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99. So either way, if somebody has a spiritual experience they are more than likely doomed to some form of mental distress, predominantly not from the experience itself, but from either repressing it due to fear, or from believing they are going \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99 if they do dare to speak out because they are told that what is happening to them isn\xe2\x80\x99t real.

184,ADC,1492,29,,F,"At the time, I had been teaching at a certain elementary school for about a year. I didnt really know any other teachers, just kept to those in my grade level. I had a dream one night about a co-workers father. I didnt know this co-worker, barely knew her first name. I didnt even talk to her as we werent even in the same grade level. It was odd that I would randomly dream about her as she was just an acquaintance. In the dream, I entered a bedroom of what seemed to be an older home. I saw this co-workers father, sitting up in a twin sized bed which was up against the wall. He was very happy, smiling, motioned me to come near him. I noticed his hands were at his heart, as if showing me he was in pain or had been in pain. Then he told me that his heart did indeed hurt, but that he wanted me to tell his daughter that he loved her very much. He did this without actually speaking. It was nonverbal communication. Thats all I remember about the dream.

188,DEE,1293,61,,F,"On August 20, 2006, Holy Spirit visited me. I was creating beaded jewelry that I sold at different outlets. I had finished a line of bracelets and cleared off my beading table, and put away all my beads, to make room for a new line of bracelets I wanted to make. I walked away from the table but when I returned, I saw in the middle of the cleaned-off area a Christian cross made up of small, clear glass pebbles. You know, the kind that are rounded on one side and flat on the other side. I liked these clear glass pebbles and kept a glass of them on my beading table to look at and to play with. The cross was positioned on the table askew--1:00 / 7:00. The lines of the glass pebbled cross were absolutely perfectly straight. The long part of the cross was made up of all one side of the pebbles while the short part was made up of the other side. I stood there and just stared at the glass cross. For the first few seconds, I was in a mild state of shock. I searched my brain to see if I had done that and forgot, but no. I thought if Hank might have done it but didnt think he would have. Then I knew where it came from and got the chills. But I had to eliminate Hank just to be sure, so I called him in. I pointed to the cross and asked if he did this. He stared at the cross and said no. I told him I didnt do it either. I told him that Holy Spirit did it. He didnt say anything about this. We looked at it some more and then went back to work. I tried to Crazy Glue the glass pebbles together to keep it as it was but the round glass pebbles wouldnt hold together even with this glue. The glue residue dirtied up the pretty clear glass pebbles (as you can see in the uploaded image) but I didnt want to clean them off. I wanted to keep them as they were. I put the pebbles in a pretty silk sack and kept it together with my other Signs from God. I went to my spiritual journal and recorded this experience, like I did with all the others. Now I keep these pebbles out in the open in the shape of the cross on a plate with my DAD envelope next to it.

195,DEE,1542,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

197,ADC,1434,45,,F,"Wish you were here. (a poem) You would love this place Dad, this forest mountain trail meandering past turquoise glacier lakes, cutting across a steep treeless loose-gravel scree. The path turns to switchback up a bare-dirt shoulder smoothed by winter\xe2\x80\x99s snow melting. At the crest, suddenly the view opens up expansive, to all horizons like the Swiss Alps. The whole Cascade range is carved at my feet: vivid green chasms, peaks painted white, no hint of civilization.  A pure sky of small cotton ball clouds streams from the horizon directly toward me, and I have to brace against this wild steady wind that spurs an endless herd of white stallions. Suddenly close and larger when leaping over this ridge, they tuck their legs at the last minute, skirting these wind-braced gnarled trees and my hand stretching up.  I used to tag along on your weekend hikes to places like this, your sanctuary. Me scurrying behind with little legs, trying to keep up with your tall, long easy strides. Death is the mystery, but I can sense you here now, Dad, in the mountains. Forgiveness allows my heart to expand; love created this place and is greater than space and time.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t hike like you did, I mountain bike. I pick up my machine here to ride back down, put on a helmet and earbuds for my Ipod. Swooping down the trail weaving through banked turns, speed and reactions are too quick for thought: rocks, a few feet of air. Me and two wheels quietly carve turns around huge ancient cedars skyscraper tall, their wizened moss-bearded branches sleepily brush puffy mist above. A postcard-intense azure sky between their reddish-brown trunks. A rush flying weightless through adrenaline-fueled bliss, this is my cathedral.  As I ride, a favorite song by Incubus always makes me think of you. It has become my prayer, telling you I am ok now.   I dig my toes into the sand,   the ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket   I lean against the wind   Pretend that I am weightless   And in this moment I am happy.   I Wish You Were Here\xe2\x80\xa6.     I lay my head onto the sand.   The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it.   Im counting ufos.   I signal them with my lighter   and in this moment i am happy,  I had a rare chance to visit your grave, passing through on my motorcycle. So many years ago this dot on a map, a hiccup in a straight flat line, was the stifling world I escaped at eighteen. Now its just a hot, dusty-small, freeway town. Surreally, everyone is a stranger. An earlier self\xe2\x80\x99s memories are just a story, gratefully too distant for emotions. The gravel road turns behind juvenile hall where I waited for my new foster mom after you died. The tiny catholic cemetery holds a few hundred family histories, a white, white statue, larger than life, divides two centuries. Mary, weeping, holds tortured Jesus in her lap. I know, neither one of us is Catholic, but mom was. I park the motorcycle. One key with one fob, a little silver disc etched with three lines one side, three broken lines the other; I-Ching symbols for Heaven and Earth.  Two unkempt, neglected yellow rose bushes grown mis-matched almost cover your name, so I trim a few branches. Ive never believed a spirit is buried, you are not here. But this is the last place on earth our paths intersected, so where else to go? No dates on the stone, I am sorry. I was too young to remember when the funeral home asked. But I am ok now.  You would be so proud of your beautiful granddaughters. The best of all of us, together.  You would like my husband, my soulmate. With him I\xe2\x80\x99ve surfed tropical waters with whales and turtles, biked Canadian passes, found love. Your spirit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to carry the burden of our grief anymore. I am no longer in a place of confused tears. Not even here. This sunny day.  Birds practice their songs above me, sitting back on an old tree; leaves quietly stirring sunbeams. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the Hispanic graves, decorated like a party. A family has recently left, spending a few happy hours with a beloved. Shiny balloons gently sway in the breeze.  Its a relief to share the peace we both so desperately needed so long ago. Then thoughts of the remaining day start to impede. A grocery list of errands, people to visit, hours on a clock, all interrupt me to leave. From the cool mowed grass I pick up my smartphone filled with facebook and emails, then in my hand the phone plays Wish You Were Here.  Dad. Are you telling me youre ok now too? I put the phone down to be here, a little while longer.  Love is greater than space and time.

198,NDA,1047,35,,M,"She was very weak, had stopped eating and couldnt swallow even an eyedropper of water. She slipped back and forth between consciousness and being non-responsive. the event began casually enough, with her periodically asking Who is that person across the room. Hospice warned me this could happen. Of course I would look and no one was there so I would say I dont know. After a couple more times of mentioning that people were standing across the room, they became closer. At one point, she saw 2 people standing right next to my sister at her bedside. My mom asked my sister Who is that? My sister asked Where? and my mom said Right beside you! Of course that totally creeped out my sister! Keep in mind that although Hospice had given her morphine which I was to deliver as needed, after the first and only time I gave it to my mom, after a few hours she woke up and asked me what I had given her. I told her morphine for the pain. She said They told me Im not supposed to take it so please dont give it to me again. I did not. So the incidents of her seeing people were becoming more frequent and she mentioned a Benjamin which my father said must have been one of her favorite distant relatives that had passed on well before I was born. He said my mother always had a connection with Benjamin in life and that they were good friends. She also saw both her parents and would carry on conversations with them. I would sit by her bedside, holding her hand and she would seem unresponsive yet mumbling as if she was talking to someone. At one point, she was talking to her deceased father, I guess, because my dad and I kept hearing the occasional Daddy come out of her mouth. All of a sudden her eyes would open and she would look directly at me and ask Can you please tell Daddy (or Aline her mother) to come back? I want to talk to them again. One morning, she asked me to go get my father, which I did. She said to him Joe I love you. He said I love you too. She said I dont know whether to LET them help me leave. (We knew she meant her parents and the others she had been talking to). My father asked If you went with them, would you be happy? She said OH YES! Then he said Well, then, you should go. Sometime after that point, they told her what time she would be departing. 1:30. We didnt know whether that meant AM or PM but her demeanor was one of anticipation. She was almost excited. She kept asking (felt like every 5 minutes) What time is it? What time is it now? What about now? Despite our grief, we had to chuckle at her reaction. After that, the next day the chaplin was scheduled to visit at 9:30 am. He called at 9:00 am to say he would be delayed. He told me he would be able to get there at 1;30 pm. the coincidence totally escaped me at that time. I walked into the bedroom and my mom perked up and asked Who was on the phone? (which by the way is really out-of-character for someone who is in a non-responsive state almost 24/7. At that point, she didnt even act as though she knew she was in her own bedroom). I told her it was the chaplin and that he would be there at 1:30 pm. She exclaimed HOW DOES HE KNOW? I had to laugh! I told her He doesnt think you are going to die at 1:30! Hes just late! (little did I know!) So, fast-forward to 1:00 pm. Tracy, the aide was with my mom and I had gone down to my house to bathe and change clothes. A very strong thought popped into my head GET DOWN THERE! I looked at the clock and it was 1:15 pm. My only thought at that point was that I didnt want to miss the chaplin. I ran down the street and met him on the sidewalk as he was leaving. After a brief exchange, I hurried into the bedroom whereby Tracy promptly grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me into the bathroom. Wide-eyed she said I just saw something! Ive never seen anything! I just saw a BIRD fly into your mothers hospital gown! It flew inside the fabric! I saw the gown billow up as it flew across her heart. Then it disappeared! I was speechless. I said come on! and we went back into the room. My mother was having trouble breathing and her lips where turning blue. I looked and Tracy and said this is it, isnt it? Very quickly, my moms skin flashed blue (anoxia?) yellow (jaundice?) then pink/grey again almost like technicolor and at the same time I could hear her lungs filling up with fluid very quickly. No longer able to take a breath, she quickly expired. It was 1:30 pm.

200,ME ,1440,21,,F,"Dear Dr. Alexander, Thank you so much for your book, Proof of Heaven. I have not had a NDE, but I experience a variety of connections with/in my own body. I thought I would share them with you so that you might be able to incorporate these ideas and implications into the knowledge you now possess. Mini-bio: I am 32 years old, lesbian, a former college athlete, white, middle-class/U.S., non-religious. When I was in my teens, I was inexplicably drawn to spiritual books for the greater part of 2-3 years, and then that continued into college (previously, I detested reading anything). There was no explanation for this; I detested organized religion as well. I read books by Brian Weiss Many Lives, Many Masters; Charles Tart (actually flew to California to see him speak); Gary Schwartz, among many others. I found myself reading anything and everything I could find on reincarnation, psychics, NDEs, mystical ideas and the like. As I read more, it seemed like the reading experience was such that the more I read, the deeper I went into things I already knew...and that is what kept me reading. In part, I also think that I connected this knowledge with a more sociological knowledge of the body/spirit, particularly by way of sexuality since I was also, simultaneously, coming into the awakening of my sexuality and the relationship between aesthetic experience and physical sensation. For me, there was this immediate connection between sexuality and spirituality. At any rate, I went on in college to major in psychology, sociology, and religion/philosophy. I was one of the very few students in school that defended the reality of psi phenomenon, having never literally not really experienced it myself up to that point. I read the stories and just knew they were real. As I read more, and defended the idea more and more, I began to experience more in the way of expanded consciousness. All of this started shortly after this 2-3 year stint of reading. My clairvoyance is somehow limited by time; I know things are going to happen and Im informed of them, but only about 10 minutes prior. I receive information/images in the waking state in the form of symbolic interactions i.e. ideas are communicated by the meaning my psyche will construct if I cogitate about what very material relations actually mean or feel like specifically to me i.e. the particular is what carries the universal intent of the message/the lesson. In your terminology, I think that is my bodys way of adapting to the inflow of messages that it knows are from the outside. Most often, it goes like this: I will be receiving information that I can feel is information coming through and I will pay very close attention to the content because I know it is not just my own random thoughts (i.e. I would probably be a good receiver in telepathic studies). I will then obsess about what I can make of the structural relations of that content in the very context of my theoretical/sociological categories/knowledge...because it seems to me that it is in figuring out that puzzle that explains why it is that Im receiving that message. Sometimes I can figure out who it needs to reach. I guess this ties in with the quotation on your website that all thoughts and actions are interconnected...and that is true at every level. Story 2: Although it may have nothing or everything do with me, the night I was on my bed studying, crying, and mourning my deceased cousin who died the night prior she came to visit me by staging a physical impossibility... because she knew that would register to me (Im also a very scientific mind I see the possible by way of the impossible. My family makes fun of me for always asking for percentages and probabilities in all aspects of life). :) Anyway, the night prior to this, I remember the light bulb above my bed blowing out I could hear the filament hit the glass of the bulb. Nonetheless, I had left the light switch up/circuit open. As I was sitting there crying the second night, thinking about Beth, and feeling guilty that we had not connected more the year before when she requested that, the light illuminated in a fashion akin to those lights that very gradually get brighter/lighter by touch. It lasted for about 10 seconds. It illuminated in a way that is not possible given the type of light it is; it wasnt on a dimmer switch. And the visual was as if a blast of energy had simply traveled through the space. I know to a degree of 100% that this light bulb had totally and completely blown out the night prior. I was sitting in the exact same place. I immediately knew it was her, and was immediately brought to tears, again. I verbally thanked her. The next day I took the light bulb to a philosophy professor of mine who was very familiar with modern physics. He was a materialist.

I was told (not verbally/audibly, but there was a consious awareness of communication, and understanding, perhaps telepathic) that I was loved. In this darkness I felt every cell of my body bathed in peace and love and comfort. No pain, not a euphoria, but just simply wonderful. It felt so good. But then I realized I had a choice to move forward to (I assumed heaven) or go back to where I had been. As good as this place made me feel, I thought about how cute my new baby sone was and how I wanted to be his mother.

I told her to come down off the stairs and she just looked at me blankly, pleadingly. That look will haunt me all my life. It was then I noticed my dressing gown belt, which was made of a silk like material around her neck. Reflecting back on this, I realise now that the stitches had broken so this had stretched giving the illusion, Tracey was standing on the stairs, leaning against the wall.    Thinking she was unconscious but alive, I realised by locking the door, I had locked out any chance of help from neighbours. I asked my little girl to go in the kitchen and get a chair.

226,DEE,1272,64,,F,"Hank and I vacationed every June at a resort in Lenox, Massachusetts. It was a week-long event that offered workshops to the many people who returned year after year.  For four years I gave a workshop called Conversations About God. This open forum invited people to talk about how they felt about God and about their spiritual experiences. It was not about religion, only God. We talked about the signs we received from God and about miracles we saw or heard in our personal lives. My goal for this workshop was for us to get close to God and to connect with each other. On Friday, June 26, 2009 at 1:45pm, I went to a room to conduct my workshop which was to start at 2:00. I was standing by the rooms door waiting to greet people as they arrived. A man walked up to me. He was a large man, about 62. He had white hair nicely styled...bald on top, longish on the bottom. He wore a geometric-designed tent garment that covered him from neck to knee. His face was clean-shaven with pink shiny cheeks. He had this powerful and pleasant look on his face. But I was struck by his face because it was glowing. There was an unmistakable glow coming from his face, as if a light was on inside his head. I could see that the glow was of a spiritual nature. I couldnt stop staring at his face and its glow. I asked this man if he was a minister. I was wondering if he was coming to my workshop for personal or professional reasons. He was friendly and said that he wasnt a minister but that he came for personal reasons. We chatted lightly while waiting for the rest of the people. Normally about 20-25 people came to my workshop but it was 2:00 and no one else showed up. We went inside and I set up chairs in a circle. One other man came. He was a regular participant who lived in Boston. We were friendly and teased each other because he was a Red Sox fan and I was a Yankees fan. By 2:10 I could see no one else was coming. I thought it was strange. Not even my husband Hank came that day and he came to all my other workshops. This man and I immediately locked into each other, talking. I dont really remember all that we talked about. That part of the conversation was blocked from my mind. The Boston man tried to talk with us but we totally ignored him, though not with malice, so he got up and left. The man and I continued our conversation. Then this stranger said to me, Youre an E.T. Master. I looked at him for a long while. I took him seriously, thats the strange part. Whats an E.T.? I was scared to ask this question because I kind of knew what ET meant and I was afraid to hear him say those words. He paused, staring at me, You know, an extraterrestrial. My spirit and my eyes were locked with his spirit and his eyes. Oh, I think I said. Im an Angel, he matter-of-factly said to me. I believed him. I believed everything he was telling me. I wasnt afraid of him and I didnt think he was crazy. I trusted and totally believed this total stranger. Thats whats so strange. I didnt even want to come up here, he said. I have work to do and a wife and children back home in Texas. I wasnt even planning to come to your workshop. I was sleeping but a loud noise woke me up so I looked on the agenda to see what workshops were scheduled. I saw your workshop and decided to come. Now I know I was sent here to see you. Whats your name? I asked. You can call me Fred. What work do you do? Im a CPA. What am I supposed to do? What are you saying to me? I dont understand. Are there books I should read? He looked away from me and said: You will be meeting people. They will show you the way. I dont remember what else we talked about in the one to two hours we talked. But I do remember that I was spiritually locked into him, like I was spiritually locked into the glow and cross and the ghost. He got up to leave and said goodbye. I said goodbye but I didnt get up. I couldnt get up. I was just sitting there, numb-like, just staring ahead. He stopped and turned around, Are you okay? Yes, Im okay, was all I could say. I sat alone in the room not really thinking about anything. Then I returned to Hank, told him a little bit about my unusual workshop but I didnt tell him then what Fred said to me. Later that night I saw Fred one more time at a dance our event put on. As soon as I saw him I went over to give him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and I said thank you. He smiled. He didnt say anything, though. We parted and I went back to Hank and we danced the night away. I remember looking for Fred in the dance room but I never saw him again. I regret not knowing his last name or not asking for his contact information.

229,DEE,1369,50,,F,"At the age of 50, I had an experience that transformed my life. I had been working with a tool in a secluded area of my home. I left the room for a few minutes, but when I returned, the tool had \xe2\x80\x9cvanished\xe2\x80\x9d and was never seen again. After exhausting every possible explanation for the disappearance, I felt my world falling apart. For the next few days, all I could do was to walk round and round the house in the hope that somehow the tool would mysteriously reappear. The experience was like being thrown into an alien universe, where all the laws of the only universe I had ever known had ceased to exist \xe2\x80\x93 it was like living in a world without gravity. When I eventually regained my composure, I began thinking of ways to solve the mystery. I had heard that the CIA uses psychics, so I made an appointment with one of these people in my area. Although he could not see what had happened to the tool, the psychic indicated that a being on the other side wanted to communicate with me. He described her as wearing a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s uniform and giving her first name as Edith. He could not understand her surname, but he thought it started with a C or a K. When I suggested \xe2\x80\x9cEdith Cavell\xe2\x80\x9d, he told me that was correct. (He had obviously never heard of the remarkable English nurse). Through the psychic, Edith accurately described a pendant I owned. She said I should hold it completely still and then ask her a question. If the answer was \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99, the pendant would move one way; if the answer was \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99, it would move another way. Being of a sceptical disposition, I did not believe that something I owned could ever move of its own accord. But on arriving home, I did what Edith had suggested and to my absolute astonishment, the pendant moved as she had indicated \xe2\x80\x93 either vertically or horizontally. After a new months of fruitful yes/no communication, I asked Edith a question one day, but instead of its usual movements, the pendant swung around in a circle. Eventually I discovered that a circle indicated the need to rephrase the question. Not long after that, Edith changed her mode of communication to one where she caused my hand to move in different directions. Then one day I asked a question, but there was no response. It turned out that Edith was handing me over to someone else. The only way I could ascertain the name of this being was to go through the alphabet. I found it almost impossible to believe that the name of the new guide I was being given was Aristotle. I was in such a state of anxiety that I contacted a renowned psychic without giving him any information about myself. At the consultation he told me he was being given a vision of philosophers in Ancient Greece. This gave me reassurance that I was not losing my mind. Aristotle told me that I should apply to do a PhD in philosophy, and that I should do a lot of background reading. To this day I have never been to a philosophy lecture \xe2\x80\x93 let alone studied in the field. When I eventually rang the Professor I had chosen, he \xe2\x80\x9cforgot\xe2\x80\x9d to ask me about the previous work I had done in philosophy.  After being accepted by the University, I began a difficult journey, but I had a wonderful supervisor who carried me through. At one point Aristotle said I would need to use a concept by the very early philosopher, Anaximander. Of course I had never heard of this thinker, but I used his concept to unite the various ideas I was presenting. Later on, Aristotle handed me over to the modern French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. By this time I had become used to the miraculous, which was just as well, because I found Jacques\xe2\x80\x99 writing difficult to grasp. In the end, thanks to all the help I was given from the other side, the two examiners I had described my dissertation as \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d. (It is titled \xe2\x80\x9cHeidegger and the mystery of being\xe2\x80\x9d and is on the web). Among other things it addresses the question of mysticism, and I am now interested in relating mystical experiences to the idea of the divine. From what I have read in Dr. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s book, and from my own experience, it seems difficult to conceive of God as an all-powerful being who sends people to hell if they don\xe2\x80\x99t repent. The evidence seems to be overwhelming that the whole of the universe is love.

I was to understand that I would not remember anything upon waking and I understood this as I was aware that I was dreaming in the dream as I was when shown the non existent color. What I was shown gave me the most intense feeling of love and made everything I knew that was stressful and upsetting seem so insignificant. I was left with the clarity that there is so much that we as humans are not to understand or know yet.

I work from home and have a large window next to my desk that looks out over our back yard. I asked Christine to send deer because I felt it would be solid confirmation if, on the very day I asked to see deer, it actually happened. Unfortunately, on this particular day I was so consumed with work that I dont even remember looking out my window. By the time I realized it was already dark outside, I also realized I never saw any deer. I was terribly disappointed with myself that I hadnt come up for air all day. Did Christine send the deer and I missed the signal to look up and out the window? Or did she not hear my plea? Maybe Im making this all up after all. I have been working on my computer moving very large files around and so before going upstairs for dinner with my wife (Christines mom), I begin a disk compression operation that takes a significant amount of time. I click the start button and go to dinner.  After dinner I came back downstairs to see the progress for my disk compression. Its going very slowly.

261,ME ,1314,33,,M,"I awake to nothing. No body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space: no near, no far, no light or dark. No heat, no cold. No emotion: no joy, no fear. Just calm awareness in a gray void.  A moment / eternity passes. Light! A brilliant sun! And with it, darkness: the fullness of empty space. A small human figure stands in silhouette. My consciousness shifts. I become the figure; a human body standing in space before a radiant globe. I feel! I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished.  I become aware that what had first appeared like a sun is un-like anything from ordinary reality. I am in the presence of a radiant, fluid luminosity. An amalgam of water and light is the best approximation I can think of. The sense of being before a conscious presence intensifies.  My mind buzzes with the desire to hold It, to explain and contain It with my thought. The more I grasp, however, the more It slips away. It cannot be grasped or named. I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away. I become light. I am one with the light. I am the light, a fluid, radiant luminosity. I have no body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light.  A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body. A thought is expressed without words: approach your live with joy and gratitude; compassion and acceptance. A cosmic chuckle: clear-eyed and hard-nosed. I am laughed at/with. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take your self so seriously\xe2\x80\x9d rings in my mind. As I turn from the light a frigorific presence rushes from behind and past my left ear. It is a transparent nothingness consuming all energy in its path. It radiates a cold animus and an implacable will to be separate; to differentiate. As it rushes past an iron darkness warps around me. It fuses to me and I become dark and solid. I awake to an ordinary day.

262,PLR,1199,37,,M,"When I looked at the map, it took me to India. Now, it is important to know that I had NEVER studied anything about India or its culture up to this point, even though I have always cooked with their spices, been attracted to their clothing, and always felt drawn to learning Ayurveda.  On the map of India, it drew me to an area called Gujarat (again, I had never heard of this place, but when I googled it, it was exactly where I was shown on the map). Making things more interesting, one of my spirit guides is named Ajwa, and there are streets and parks in Gujarat named Ajwa.  The next thing I knew, I was mentally whisked to a beautiful area, and to a house where I lived with my mother and father. At first it was nice and peaceful and I felt at home. I was female and in brightly colored clothes that I loved. I remember the area was so green and lush. My mother and father there were my brother and wife in this life. This was the mid 1800s, and the British military were there.  They came in the night and took my mother away to rape and kill her. I remember the panic I felt knowing I would never see her again. What is really interesting is that prior to this event, I was always terrified of my wife getting kidnapped and killed. Since this event, I have no fear because I know it is left over from India. Anyway, the English soldiers came back the next day and burned our village. I was raped and my nipples cut off. I remember being held down in one of the buildings, like a stable, as others looked on.

266,ME ,1478,46,,M,"This life changing event happened to me the latter part of October 2004  For many years I\xe2\x80\x99d been searching for a closer walk with God and financial success. My library of books and tapes are very extensive. I have read many books over twice and listened to tapes and CD\xe2\x80\x99s over and over and over again. I\xe2\x80\x99d started this learning process about 5 years ago and for the last three years I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten very serious about it. So much so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t read the paper, I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch the news on TV and my TV time is limited to almost nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve rented about 5 movies in the last five years. No movie theaters and I\xe2\x80\x99d recently turned off the car radio of any type of media or learning material and just thought positive thoughts while driving. The books that I read are the Bible, books on how our minds work, books on Personal Development and Spirituality. However I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe that the Spirit world existed So one day I have no Idea how I got there but I\xe2\x80\x99m on the website of a well known Success coach and trainer. On her site an interesting book catches my eye. I order the book and it arrives quickly. I start reading the book and it makes allot of sense. About a third way through the book I come upon a passage that says \xe2\x80\x9cOk, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to now tell you about my 5 agreements in business not to be confused with the Four Agreements of Don Miguel Ruiz. If you want to learn about his four agreements you can get his book titled the Four Agreements and read about them\xe2\x80\x9d.  Nothing else was mentioned about that subject and I kept reading. About 3 pages after that statement I felt compelled to go back. I found the author and the title of the book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Four Agreements\xe2\x80\x9d. I was sitting at my desk in front of my computer so I went to Ebay and clicked on a Buy It Now and had the book in my hand three day\xe2\x80\x99s later. I thought it came to me very quickly. The book is written I am told, at a sixth grade level and it has about 140 pages. So I ate it up and read it in about 3 days. After reading it I thought to myself. This book makes so much sense. Just 4 agreements and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to memorize a bunch of affirmations and make sure that I find the right one to say for the situation in my stack of 3X5\xe2\x80\x99 cards. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking this is one of the best books I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and it\xe2\x80\x99s so simple to understand and implement. So I go in for round two with this book. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read it again. About half way through the book is when it happens. My vision: It\xe2\x80\x99s 10:00am and I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting at my home office desk reading the book for the second time. The morning light is shining through my French doors. I\xe2\x80\x99m about half way through it when the room goes dark. I turn my chair to the left toward the light switch to see who\xe2\x80\x99s there. I stand and I drop the book to the floor out of my left hand. My desk is to my right. The book lands on a wood floor, bounces a couple of times and makes an echo like a book bouncing on a wood floor in an empty room. (The floor in my office is carpeted) I look around my room and it\xe2\x80\x99s not my room anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s now as large as a high school gym and empty of everything except for my desk and chair and the floor is wood. My Room looks like an empty school gym. It is then that I see my office door. It\xe2\x80\x99s glowing and the colors on it have changed from white to Lapis Blue and the handle on the door is glowing an Orange/Gold color. The door appears to be breathing in and out. On it\xe2\x80\x99s in breath the door is puffed up and show cracks with the orange/gold color in them. The door and handle are illuminated like they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to explode and catch fire. I see smoke coming in from the door jam around the door frame on its out breath. I walk slowly to the door and grab the handle. I turn it clockwise and crack the door open about an inch to peak outside my room. An intense and bright white light comes through the one inch space. It startles me because of its intense brightness and the speed at which it came through the door so close to my face. The light is just like a laser. It is focused. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like it\xe2\x80\x99s flooding the room with light it\xe2\x80\x99s like a laser beam of bright white/golden light 1 inch wide and as tall as the door. In the light are many small brown particles about the size of pencil erasers. They\xe2\x80\x99re floating and moving along in the light, going by me, not real fast as they come in the door.   Then I open the door all the way. The door opens inward and from left to right.

272,ME ,1269,59,,F,"(Repeat of #43) I was driving my car alone and running errands during the daytime. It was an ordinary, sunny July day during the week. I was driving past the Briarcliff Congregational Church in Briarcliff Manor, New York, a small, Westchester County suburban community, a one-hour drive north of Manhattan. I glanced over at the churchs directory sign to read it. It said You say theres distance between you and God. Who moved? I immediately stopped my car and held up traffic, stared at those words and thought for a few seconds about that question. I remember answering that question to myself: I moved. It was I who moved because God doesnt move. Hes all around us. I suddenly realized what I was saying and I said to myself: Why am I answering this question? I dont believe in God. Then I started to cry and I was shaking in my car. It was a soft cry and a mild shaking. But I was aware that I was being moved by something. I heard the car horns blaring behind me but ignored them. I knew I had to make an instant decision to stay with this feeling or cut it off, ignore it and continue on with my chores. Although I was a little frightened at the unknown feelings and event that were overtaking me, I decided to stay with my feelings. I pulled across the street into the empty parking lot of the little Briarcliff Public Library and parked in a quiet corner of the lot. I sat crying and shaking and let whatever it was overtake me. I was still a little frightened but I decided to trust the event. I suddenly looked down and saw that my chest was ethereally slowly opening up and a current of wavy air was entering my chest. This did not at all frighten me. I did not hear anything, touch anything or smell anything. (With me, all my visions, signs and visits by Holy Spirit were always visual. I guess since God made me a visual artist, It comes to me in a visual form.) God then played with me a game of spiritual connect the dots. It released from my memory spiritual experiences from my past that I had heretofore forgotten but remembered when they became fresh again in my memory. (Ill be registering each one in separate forms on your site.) I was sitting in my car for about one half hour and in that half hour I went from believing nothing to believing everything. I knew there really was a God. I knew that Jesus was the Son of God. I knew there really was a Holy Spirit. I knew the Bible was true. And I felt that God wanted me to be Christian, so I converted myself from Judaism to Christianity on the spot. No one came over to me while I sat in my car. I was infused with a tremendous new and exciting spiritual energy and couldnt wait to go home and tell Hank, my husband, all about it.

I actually could not see these people they did not reveal themselves. I saw an outline like an aura white and thin foggy. Someone said to me telepathically come over. I hesitated scared I remember and said Im not ready. Then snap I was lying down again and opened my eyes. The room was exactly how I saw it through them closed other than the beings were gone. I felt like I knew these people intimately more than the people I know in this world even though I couldnt see them I sensed they were close to me like family like my real family. I felt I could trust them but that I hadnt completed my purposes on earth yet. I was in effect asking for more time.

293,NDE,1388,54,,M,"Bam!  That had to be a plane, I thought to myself. Nothing else could possibly be moving that fast. The force of the impact had snapped the drivers seat off and I felt the car being catapulted forward. That in itself was alarming.  I had been traveling north on I-75 just north of Atlanta, GA and had just been readying to exit the North Marietta Loop traveling at about 60 mph when the impact from behind had occurred. Just a couple minutes prior I had seen some jets taking off from Dobbins Air Base. It wasnt a plane that hit me though. It was an uninsured 19 yr old driving an unregistered vehicle. Witness reports put his speed at over a 100 mph as he wove in and out of traffic coming up I-75.  The impact caused the back end of my car to jerk out to the right. The wheels on my Toyata Corolla seemed to grab the road surface. I could feel the car begin to turn over. I knew how fast I was going. I knew the car would be turning over and over in a wild tumble. It was without a doubt one of those entire life in a flash moments. There wasnt a lot of time for any lengthy reminiscing though.  Just two thoughts went through my mind. The first was a pondering why Divine Spirit had chosen this time for me. Wow, I really thought Ive learned a lot in this life. Im just at the point in life where I might be able to offer others something worthwhile. Why now?  The second thought was expressed in a spirit of surrendering, God, I really only have one request. Id really like to take all that Ive learned with me to my next life. Please dont require me to learn everything all over again. Reincarnation is something that Im completely familiar and comfortable with.  The car began to flip over. I could hear the metal shearing and the glass shattering all around me. I felt the tumbling effect. I felt like I was inside a long tunnel like whirlpool. In the center of that incredibly fast spinning darkness I saw a bright white light, warm like the sun, very quiet and very serene.  Total silence.  I opened my eyes. Cool, I thought. I made it through this and Im not even hurt! No pain at all!  Then I tried to move. Not so much as a finger responded. I was lying face down, head in the back seat, my feet somewhere up around the area of the steering wheel. A thumb was pressing hard against my nose and lip. I could see that it appeared, by its relative positioning, to be the thumb from my left hand, but it was my right thumb. I could also see that my right arm bent in an awkward position under my throat. God, Im glad Im paralyzed because that would really hurt if I could feel it, I said to myself.  Totally paralyzed, I thought to myself. Quadriplegic. I will be a burden on everyone for the rest of my life.  I then concluded that because I was unable to feel any pain, that I probably had serious internal injuries as well. I would die here, but at least I would die without pain. I thanked Divine Spirit for that blessing.  I could literally feel myself, as Spirit, sinking slowly down and out of my body. It was a deeply sickening feeling. Then I heart a tapping sound. Are you all right? a womans trembling voice asked.  Im paralyzed. Call the police, call the ambulance. I said. At least I could talk, I thought to myself.  That started a flurry of activity. Over the next half hour, I heard sirens, people yelling and screaming, and the unmistakable sound of a helicopter. All the while I laid face down, head in the back seat, not moving. All the doors were jammed. The parameds were frantically trying to reach me and couldnt. They kept saying, Stay with us now, stay with us. They ended up cutting off the entire roof of the car and very carefully they lifted me out. I was placed on a stretcher, moved to level ground, and was immediately given an IV.  At least 5 or 6 medical personal surrounded me. The one directly above my face said to me, Mr., youre going to be all right. Then a womans voice said, Mr., have you made arrangements for organ transplants?  Yeah, I said. Its on my drivers license. I could see the guy directly above me stare down the lady who said it.  Then another voice spoke up. Mr, do you have a living will?  No, I said. I looked up at the guy above me and said, Im in it pretty deep, huh?  He smiled down at me and said Id be fine. Yeah, right, I thought to myself.  They strapped me in the lifeflight helicopter. Off I went to the Atlanta Medical Center Spinal Trauma Unit, the best such facility for hundreds of miles in all directions. Upon arriving I was placed in the operating room recovery room. Apparently there was more room there for all the medical personnel to gather round me.  After being taken for CAT Scans and an MRI I was returned to the recovery room.

295,DEE,1234,24,,M,"Introduction While I read through \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven\xe2\x80\x9d I was struck by the similarity of several distinct items that were present within a spiritual experience that occurred to me. The items that Dr. Eben Alexander presented in \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven that were similar if not identical to what I experienced are as follows: 1.) Peoples clothes were natural to the environment. 2.) The experiences were perceived to be magnitudes more real than normal life. 3.) The \xe2\x80\x9cglorious chant\xe2\x80\x9d was everywhere and came from many places. 4.) A exhilarating sense of unity with all that exists. 5.) Dr. Eben Alexanders description of communication as, \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts that entered me directly\xe2\x80\x9d is similar to the direct communication with the Word of God that came upon me. The Word communicated as if through every subatomic particle field--not through words but through the Word of God. Although the religious experience written here is in dream format, the information transferred and situations experienced were of a supra consciousness nature. The religious experience developed as an independent psychological process over a twenty year period--from adolescence to adulthood. The religious experience happened to me at age 24 on September 03, 1979. I am 57 years old. Since I was 24 years old I have had no extraordinary psychological experiences. Personal experiences with direct spiritual development of consciousness are eternal and transcend both living experiences and after death experiences. Heaven is not strictly an after death state and something, perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic mind,\xe2\x80\x9d interacts with the human brain and shares some obscure affinity with each human mind. In a sense \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d is omnipresent; heaven is all around us but we typically fail to see it. Both living and after death experiences attest to this fact. This experience is of the living variety.  The Trances From age 4 through 21 I had experienced approximately 10 trances that would take me to what seemed like another dimension. My first recollection, of two symbols that appeared in one form or another throughout the trances and in the religious experience, was from a time as a kid with high fever. I saw two sparkling nuns that were walking along an infinite seashore. Children were playing beneath a sun umbrella and fragile autumn leaves blew across the sand. I perceived an infinitely dense black line coming from the sky to crush the leaves, the sun umbrella and the children. I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe line. the line\xe2\x80\x9d as my mother put cold water and rubbing alcohol on my forehead to reduce the fever. The trances stopped occurring during fever (associated with illness) around 10 years old. But I would try to stay awake by watching T.V. late into the night because I knew the trance would take place if I fell asleep and that scared me. Usually when the trance started Id get up out of bed and sit in a chair. The experience then caused the world to fade out. The walls of the room would disappear and a dark space with two huge dense masses of sparkling energy would transfer their energy back and forth through a sparkling, connecting line along which the energy flowed. I had no recognition of my presence. When the one mass would become infinitesimal to the point of disappearing, the other would become dense and heavy. Then I would become frightened. But, eventually, the energy would transfer out of the dense and heavy sparkling mass along the line and back into the one that almost disappeared. The last few times, around 20 years old, when I experienced the trances, the episodes were witnessed without fear. Id get up out of bed, sit on a couch and simply watch the show. Afterwords, I thought that was really strange but it didnt make any sense so I didnt think much of it. When I was 24 years old, at a time when my mind was biologically mature, I had a profound religious experience that seemed to be the end result of the trances. It was in the form of a dream that I could understand. Although this experience was in dream-like symbolism. I experienced it far greater than waking life experiences. Perception and emotion while in it had been enhanced. I often referred to an increase of reality to a magnitude of 10 when recounting the experience. Carl Jung stated that what acts is actual and this experience was actually the most intense experience in my life. Like a dream that you try to recall, while it fades away with the more time that passes between waking and the writing of it, much of the details escaped my memory at the time of writing it. I was in tears and quite overwhelmed upon waking but some parts of the dream that I remember and wrote are still remembered along with the emotional intensity as evidenced in my consistent effort",,US Citize,2001 2,spiritual,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,dail,week,very strong,avera,"0 24,999",some,Machini,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

303,OBE,1229,44,,M,"Almost immediately after taking the divine plant I began to fall out of my body. It was a wholly new sensation for me. After years of pursuing the actual out of body occurrence it was nothing as I had imagined it to be. There is noting that can compare one for the actual sensation. During numerous mediations I had always imagined myself rising above my body to look down and view myself. But this is not what actually happened. I actually fell into myself. I literally fell out of myself and by falling inside myself. And then instantly found myself floating above my body laying on the bed. The experience of being pulled out of the body was not an unpleasant sensation rather it was the first time to feel it and all firsts are usually associated with some fear. In this case it happened so fast and the train I was on had no exit routes, so I was on it for the duration. Once I was above my body the experience was quite pleasant. I was amazed at how I looked. I also notice the family cat was aware of my presence which I found quite interesting as it gazed upon my astral body. Just as I was becoming acquainted with my new surroundings I was yanked yet again in another direction at an astounding rate through a tunnel towards a light. Upon reaching the end of the tunnel I seemed to be deposited on the other side of a threshold. This place was completely and utterly spectacular. I was suddenly connected to everything was the feeling I remember most. I only needed to think of something and the associated response was with me. The communication was so much different here. I wasnt thinking in words but pictures associated with strong feelings and emotions. And I was like a newborn. I had very little experience in this new environment. It was very much a fish out of water experience. The thing that left the most lasting impression on me was this. I was able to look back on where I had just come from. The physical world. It was close. I could perceive it clearly as if it were a separate dimension but very close. I began to focus on the edges of it as it didnt seem to be wholly formed yet. The colors were so vibrant and alive.  So organic. The edges looked like caviar. And It came into me that I was perceiving the physical on a molecular level. I was so amazed. Then suddenly it came through me like a lightening bolt. These molecules perceived me. They were aware I was looking at them. Communication!! Images and information passed at an alarming rate. I was aware of the rythme and reason for everything coming into being. It filled me with a sense of joy I had never felt before. I laughed. I knew what life really was. These small bits of life....molecules...all formed based on collective thoughts. We all were creating everyday. We just didnt realize how powerful our thoughts we were. Then I was aware of a presence behind me. It was so brite and so large. My first thoughts were not of intrigue but of how small and dim I was. And just this tiny bit of hesitation flooded me with thoughts of....had I killed myself. Suddenly I was flooded with thoughts of fear. I wanted to know if I was alive. I yearned to feel my body again. So I prayed to feel my body again. And I was propelled in that direction. It was not an easy maneuver. It took some time to anchor myself in my body but it was accomplished. I had set up a timer on the side of the night stand. Total duration was 15 minutes. It had felt like an eternity. There was actually no sensation of time where I had gone. It did not exist.

No heat, no cold. No emotion: no joy, no fear. Just calm awareness in a gray void.  A moment / eternity passes. Light! A brilliant sun! And with it, darkness: the fullness of empty space. A small human figure stands in silhouette. My consciousness shifts. I become the figure; a human body standing in space before a radiant globe. I feel! I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished.  I become aware that what had first appeared like a sun is un-like anything from ordinary reality. I am in the presence of a radiant, fluid luminosity. An amalgam of water and light is the best approximation I can think of. The sense of being before a conscious presence intensifies.  My mind buzzes with the desire to hold It, to explain and contain It with my thought. The more I grasp, however, the more It slips away. It cannot be grasped or named. I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away. I become light. I am one with the light. I am the light, a fluid, radiant luminosity. I have no body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light.  A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body. A thought is expressed without words: approach your live with joy and gratitude; compassion and acceptance. A cosmic chuckle: clear-eyed and hard-nosed. I am laughed at/with. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take your self so seriously\xe2\x80\x9d rings in my mind. As I turn from the light a frigorific presence rushes from behind and past my left ear. It is a transparent nothingness consuming all energy in its path. It radiates a cold animus and an implacable will to be separate; to differentiate. As it rushes past an iron darkness warps around me. It fuses to me and I become dark and solid. I awake to an ordinary day.

305,ADC,1408,49,,M,"I was drifting off to sleep, somewhat melancholy, because I had been thinking of my brother, who passed away in 1994. He was my younger brother. My wife was out of town, taking care of her terminally ill mother in her final days. It was a time of sadness and raw emotion. As I lay in bed, finally relaxing and beginning to drift towards sleep, I felt a presence fill the room. An overwhelming feeling of love filled me. It was love in a fullness like I had never experienced. At the same time, the room seemed to fill with a fragrance that was undeniably my father. It was the smell of his clean, fresh laundered shirts. It was the fragrance that I most associated with him. This feeling went on for a period of time, but I dont know how much time elapsed. It did not just come and go though, it persisted long enough for me to realize that I was experiencing something very special.

307,DEE,1205,45,,F,"Well it has been a few years, but here is what happened. I was at Mass. We attend weekly. This week, for some reason, my eyes kept being drawn towards the rafters above the altar. I kept feeling a presence, actually two, playfully going from rafter to rafter. Ive felt presences before, never at church. Whenever I do, I usually just ignore, or if it is strong enough, tell it to call on the name of Christ. So the feeling kept getting stronger and stronger, I finally stated silently for the things to play quieter so I could concentrate on the Mass. They didnt leave though. And we lined up for the Holy Eucharist, and I received the Body of Christ from Rita, a long time parishoner and dedicated Eucharistic minister. As soon as she gave the Host to me, I didnt even get to walk to my seat when I heard a loud CRASH! The silver bowl witht the Host was dropped because Rita collapsed and died on the spot. As soon as that happened, I slowly felt the presences leave. Come to find out about a week later at Ritas funeral, that she used to be a nun, she was in love with the Eucharist, and her life-long wish was to die IN THE CHURCH, GIVING OUT THE EUCHARIST. Those angels in the rafters (or whatever celestial beings they were) were there for Rita. I only observed, or felt their presence. This isnt the first time Ive felt unearthly presences, but most definitely the strongest. You can check on Ritas death if you want to confirm this, just let me know and I will give you the name of the parish and the presiding priest. Please keep me nameless, for now. Thank you.

312,ME ,1489,56,,M," By about nine p.m. I noticed that I was hearing songs in a way I never had before. I seemed to be entering more deeply than usual into the mind of the writer and understanding what was being emotionally conveyed. So I kept listening. I felt the sorrows and joys of others as they spoke to me in song. I felt the tragic beauty in the passions, lost hopes and brevity of life as experienced by other people. There was a collision of sadness and beauty, a kind of majestic sorrow. I wondered if it was due to being fifty six years of age and being able to relate to many situations in life. Shivers repeatedly rose in waves up my spine from its base. I could not recall ever enjoying music to such an extent. I identified so closely with the singers, I became them. I could get up and go to the bathroom or get a drink of chilled water from the kitchen without losing the spinal effect. I then returned to the headphones and Yahoo Radio on the computer. The shivers of pleasure continued to rise in waves up my spine and began to intensify and surge down my legs and up my arms. The base of my head, at the rear, where the spine joins the skull was hit by waves of exquisite sensation with each new song. It felt like a hand was gripping the upper back of my neck where it meets the skull, and channelling in high voltage pleasure direct to my brain. After each wave of energy up my spine, this sensation did not totally subside, but seemed to remain as a scintillation of increased magnitude higher than the level before it. I became concerned as the euphoric physical effects intensified and extended in duration. I checked my pulse by the clock to see if I had an elevated heart rate associated with panic attacks. My pulse was normal and steady and my body felt very, very relaxed. I had the sensation of settling or falling back, deeper within my body, as the experience continued. My mind was paradoxically calm, intensely present, sharply aware and my cognition totally functioning and nimble. The waves of sensation up my spine became a volcanic rush that entered my head. I was thinking \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Oh, Oh! Awesome! Go with it!\xe2\x80\x9d Rivers of energy flowed outwards along my limbs. By now it was after midnight. My body felt almost weightless. I felt immense power flowing through my body. At one point I looked at my hands and they felt so full of the sensation of energy and so insubstantial that I wondered if they might pass through the wall if I tried. I touched the wall out of curiosity and my hand was certainly still solid as it touched the wall! It was just that I could not feel my hand. It went on and on, hour after hour as powerful waves of surging energy, ever intensifying. I was totally immersed in intense ecstasy. Suddenly, there was another huge rush of energy upwards. There was complete darkness. I found my locus of consciousness now resting in the centre of my head as a tiny pin point. The room I was sitting in had totally disappeared from sight. It was dark and comforting in the centre of my brain. Then, there was a final atomic eruption I could feel rising beneath this tiny \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d, my centre of total awareness, and it burst forth from the top of my head carrying that tiny point in a massive torrent of energy that felt like a clear, cool viscous liquid, and my awareness emerged into a infinite yet intimate space which was like an endless ocean where I felt connected to all things in the cosmos. I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! I must have died! Oh well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d I had no fear. I was merely a point of consciousness with no body at all. I was overcome with immense gratitude for the privilege of having been alive, and for my life with its joys as well as its sorrows and the total improbability of just being. I thanked God.  Following on was an instantaneous, total life review. It was like viewing a three hundred and sixty degree panoramic picture screen with all of my life events played out simultaneously. Many of the things I had thought very significant in my life were not at all important. My preconceptions of right and wrong melted away. I did not feel judged in any way, I felt completely accepted. Everything was meaningful in my life and nothing I had experienced was wasted. The only things that now mattered in my past life were the times I had shown loving compassion to other people and living things. Then I felt enormous, limitless, feelings of joy, love, compassion and empathy for humankind and all living things. I felt intimate kinship with all humanity. I somehow was The Divine Mother with a heart for all my suffering beings and wanted to encompass them in arms of love and mercy and tell them everything was all right and always had been. Everything was perfect and always had been and always would be.

I told her to come down off the stairs and she just looked at me blankly, pleadingly. That look will haunt me all my life. It was then I noticed my dressing gown belt, which was made of a silk like material around her neck. Reflecting back on this, I realise now that the stitches had broken so this had stretched giving the illusion, Tracey was standing on the stairs, leaning against the wall.    Thinking she was unconscious but alive, I realised by locking the door, I had locked out any chance of help from neighbours. I asked my little girl to go in the kitchen and get a chair. Put it near the bench and stand on it. On the top of the cabinets above, there are some scissors, bring them to me?

336,DEE,1234,24,,M,"Introduction While I read through \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven\xe2\x80\x9d I was struck by the similarity of several distinct items that were present within a spiritual experience that occurred to me. The items that Dr. Eben Alexander presented in \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven that were similar if not identical to what I experienced are as follows: 1.) Peoples clothes were natural to the environment. 2.) The experiences were perceived to be magnitudes more real than normal life. 3.) The \xe2\x80\x9cglorious chant\xe2\x80\x9d was everywhere and came from many places. 4.) A exhilarating sense of unity with all that exists. 5.) Dr. Eben Alexanders description of communication as, \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts that entered me directly\xe2\x80\x9d is similar to the direct communication with the Word of God that came upon me. The Word communicated as if through every subatomic particle field--not through words but through the Word of God. Although the religious experience written here is in dream format, the information transferred and situations experienced were of a supra consciousness nature. The religious experience developed as an independent psychological process over a twenty year period--from adolescence to adulthood. The religious experience happened to me at age 24 on September 03, 1979. I am 57 years old. Since I was 24 years old I have had no extraordinary psychological experiences. Personal experiences with direct spiritual development of consciousness are eternal and transcend both living experiences and after death experiences. Heaven is not strictly an after death state and something, perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic mind,\xe2\x80\x9d interacts with the human brain and shares some obscure affinity with each human mind. In a sense \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d is omnipresent; heaven is all around us but we typically fail to see it. Both living and after death experiences attest to this fact. This experience is of the living variety.  The Trances From age 4 through 21 I had experienced approximately 10 trances that would take me to what seemed like another dimension. My first recollection, of two symbols that appeared in one form or another throughout the trances and in the religious experience, was from a time as a kid with high fever. I saw two sparkling nuns that were walking along an infinite seashore. Children were playing beneath a sun umbrella and fragile autumn leaves blew across the sand. I perceived an infinitely dense black line coming from the sky to crush the leaves, the sun umbrella and the children. I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe line. the line\xe2\x80\x9d as my mother put cold water and rubbing alcohol on my forehead to reduce the fever. The trances stopped occurring during fever (associated with illness) around 10 years old. But I would try to stay awake by watching T.V. late into the night because I knew the trance would take place if I fell asleep and that scared me. Usually when the trance started Id get up out of bed and sit in a chair. The experience then caused the world to fade out. The walls of the room would disappear and a dark space with two huge dense masses of sparkling energy would transfer their energy back and forth through a sparkling, connecting line along which the energy flowed. I had no recognition of my presence. When the one mass would become infinitesimal to the point of disappearing, the other would become dense and heavy. Then I would become frightened. But, eventually, the energy would transfer out of the dense and heavy sparkling mass along the line and back into the one that almost disappeared. The last few times, around 20 years old, when I experienced the trances, the episodes were witnessed without fear. Id get up out of bed, sit on a couch and simply watch the show. Afterwords, I thought that was really strange but it didnt make any sense so I didnt think much of it. When I was 24 years old, at a time when my mind was biologically mature, I had a profound religious experience that seemed to be the end result of the trances. It was in the form of a dream that I could understand. Although this experience was in dream-like symbolism. I experienced it far greater than waking life experiences. Perception and emotion while in it had been enhanced. I often referred to an increase of reality to a magnitude of 10 when recounting the experience. Carl Jung stated that what acts is actual and this experience was actually the most intense experience in my life. Like a dream that you try to recall, while it fades away with the more time that passes between waking and the writing of it, much of the details escaped my memory at the time of writing it. I was in tears and quite overwhelmed upon waking but some parts of the dream that I remember and wrote are still remembered along with the emotional intensity as evidenced in my consistent effort",,US Citize,2001 2,spiritual,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,dail,week,very strong,avera,"0 24,999",some,Machini,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

When asked if I wanted to stay I was ambivilant and asked what I REALLY wanted and why. I realized I needed to get back as my mother would be destroyed if I died.

347,NDE,1093,29,,F,"The next thing I became aware of after being in the hallway was seeing my body below me. I was lying on a table, my lower half covered in blue draping. There was a doctor handing someting to a person at my right shoulder who took it and quickly and turned her back to me. I saw her arms moving very quickly, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what she was doing. There was blood all over my abdomen. Another doctor was threading something into my chest, he was at my left side. Someone else came into the room to my right.  I was \xe2\x80\x9cfloating\xe2\x80\x9d past the ceiling. I was aware of this detail and found it interesting. I was \xe2\x80\x9cKrista\xe2\x80\x9d but not attached to the body below or the events going on in the room. I was simply an observer. I wanted to keep watching but was pulled to my left by a very strong force. I resisted only for an instant, then knew I must go. It was almost as if I was \xe2\x80\x9csucked\xe2\x80\x9d into this tunnel-like space. There were no defining \xe2\x80\x9cwalls\xe2\x80\x9d, only a static-like grey/white/black type of atmosphere throughout. I was a part of this static. I was moving at lightening speed. There was no time, and I remained Krista throughout the entire event. In the tunnel I next felt the bliss of all-penetrating, all encompassing love. No words can describe this feeling. I was \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d. All the questions I\xe2\x80\x99d ever had in my life were answered in an instant. The confirmation I was given was that we are here to love one another. Period. We are here to love. The next thing that happened was I was emerging from the static to a light grey illumination that was sort of milky cloudy in substance. There were beings lined up to my left, waiting for me to arrive. I did not know any of these beings. There was a young boy, around 12, who wore a round brimmed hat, like a child would have in the 1800\xe2\x80\x99s. For an instant I wanted to be there, then I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I was back in the tunnel very briefly when it opened up to this vast, indescribably beautiful landscape. Breathtaking. I was immensely joyful and so very loved by it and everything. There were bright yellow flowers spread out across the ground in front of me. A forest lay to the right. A rock waterfall surrounded in lush greenery to the left. Past the flowers were undulating green grass hills dotted with trees and a bright blue sky above. It was Eden. It was home. In an instant I was given the choice to leave and I did. I knew I needed to be back here and be a mother. My next memory was of being in the ICU.

349,DEE,1261,24,,F,"Earlier in the evening, I was very lonely as my new husband was gone a lot. I had only been married about 6 months, and I was beginning to realize that perhaps I had made a mistake marrying this man...that he wasnt all that in love with me. A few days earlier, I had said a prayer and asked if this was all there was to marriage and asked for help from God even though I want sure if there really was a God.  A few days later, I was asleep next to my husband. And I felt like I was having a dream with this bright light appearing. It was the brightest light I had ever seen...almost a piercing blue white light. I opened my eyes and realized this was not a dream at all! I looked into my closest where the doors were open and out of the left back side of the closest, the light radiated from. I wasnt scared...actually it was quite comforting. I quickly woke my husband up. He couldnt believe what he was seeing either. I kept saying, what is it? Is this real or are we imaging it. We both just sat there for about a minute staring at the light. Again, it was the brightest light I had ever seen but, the light didnt radiate throughout the room but stayed concentrated in the closest. After it disappeared, I just continued to sit up in bed trying to figure out what had just happened. Then, out of the blue, I began speaking in a language that I had never heard. My husband heard me, and thought I was going crazy. I had no idea what was happening. It wasnt scary....just really weird. This continued non stop for about 3 hours until I was completely exhausted and went to sleep at about 6am that am. When I woke up, I was completely perplexed as to what just happened to me. I decided I needed to go talk to someone about this so I went and visited with my priest at the Episcopal church at the time. He tried to explain it but, I was still perplexed as I had never heard of speaking I tongues, nor had I asked to have that given to me. To this day, I can still speak In tongues though I rarely do.

A thick blanket of love came over me from my feet to my head. This was symbolic and like an introduction for the next images. I was shown a large area. A kind of birds eye view was shown to me and a thick blanket of love was pulled over that area which was taken by IS. It became clear to me that this blanket of love was made by numerous souls who were concerned and sending their love. This love was enormous and the concern was like from a mother towards her children. It became clear to me that the love was there and it could heal if people wanted to. It was up to them (the IS-soldiers). Their (the IS-soldiers) decision, their free will, was the result of the mess and suffering. I was told to be not afraid. Never!

356,ADC,1290,62,,F,"On January 4, 2007, I was alone in the kitchen of my home in Ossining, NY. My husband was upstairs working. I like my home orderly and keep everything in its place. It was daytime and I was preparing some food when my eye caught an object by the floor. I looked down and saw a little white square paper wedged up against the dark green backsplash runner by the floor. I picked up the paper. It was actually an empty little envelope with a gold lining inside. The envelope looked like it was opened after it was sealed because it had a rip in the flap. It was the kind of gift envelope that contained a card with someones name on it that youd give with a gift at Christmas. On the front of the envelope was the hand-printed word Dad. It looked like my handwriting but I didnt remember giving my father this envelope in the 2 1/2 years we were communicating just before his passing, and we didnt talk to each other for 29 years previously. In my home, a random and obscure object just doesnt turn up mysteriously in a strange place like that. I stood there with a shocked feeling, staring at the envelope. I thought I knew it came from a spiritual source but I wasnt ready to accept that. I had to rule out all possibilities. I called for Hank to come down and showed him the envelope. I asked if it was his. He said no. I asked if he ever saw this before. No. Could he imagine where it came from? No. I asked if it fell out of the newspapers he recycles in the kitchen. He said no. I told him where I found it and that it came from Holy Spirit. Hank became agitated and got a little angry. He was annoyed that mysterious, spiritual things like this were happening to me and darted back upstairs to his office. I stood there looking at the envelope and asked out loud: Dad, are you here with me now? Suddenly, a brisk wind came across my bare shins and I felt the chills. Then I knew my father was with me. I wanted to know more about this mystery, so I called a cousin of Hanks who was a Deacon at a Catholic Church in New Orleans. I asked Gary what all this meant. He said that God made my father my Guardian Angel and that my father would be watching over me. This was awesome. Although I had had a love/hate relationship with my father, I just loved him now and was happy to know he was with me. I have fond, loving memories bonding with my father in my childhood and enjoying life with him. (Im uploading a photo of this envelope.

358,DEE,1293,61,,F,"On August 20, 2006, Holy Spirit visited me. I was creating beaded jewelry that I sold at different outlets. I had finished a line of bracelets and cleared off my beading table, and put away all my beads, to make room for a new line of bracelets I wanted to make. I walked away from the table but when I returned, I saw in the middle of the cleaned-off area a Christian cross made up of small, clear glass pebbles. You know, the kind that are rounded on one side and flat on the other side. I liked these clear glass pebbles and kept a glass of them on my beading table to look at and to play with. The cross was positioned on the table askew--1:00 / 7:00. The lines of the glass pebbled cross were absolutely perfectly straight. The long part of the cross was made up of all one side of the pebbles while the short part was made up of the other side. I stood there and just stared at the glass cross. For the first few seconds, I was in a mild state of shock. I searched my brain to see if I had done that and forgot, but no. I thought if Hank might have done it but didnt think he would have. Then I knew where it came from and got the chills. But I had to eliminate Hank just to be sure, so I called him in. I pointed to the cross and asked if he did this. He stared at the cross and said no. I told him I didnt do it either. I told him that Holy Spirit did it. He didnt say anything about this. We looked at it some more and then went back to work. I tried to Crazy Glue the glass pebbles together to keep it as it was but the round glass pebbles wouldnt hold together even with this glue. The glue residue dirtied up the pretty clear glass pebbles (as you can see in the uploaded image) but I didnt want to clean them off. I wanted to keep them as they were. I put the pebbles in a pretty silk sack and kept it together with my other Signs from God. I went to my spiritual journal and recorded this experience, like I did with all the others.

Then the person driving it would over-correct and speed across the interstate in front of me just in time for me to T-bone the car and kill both of us. The voice told me to simply take my foot off the gas and coast...that would slow my car enough to avoid hitting the car and the semis behind me would not hit me.

The car started running off to the left into the median kicking grass up and speeding toward the steel barrier...at 1st I thought it would be sliced in 2 right down the middle, but then the driver began to swerve back into my lane.

374,SDE,1278,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

I experienced him as though he was in his 20s vibrant,strong, full head of hair, but with the persona of when he died in his 80s. The last one I had was the one that had the most dramatic influence on my spiritual life. He communicated with me about something mundane again I actually dont recall the issue now. But after that communication, he told me that he would not be communicating with me anymore. I cant say that it was like a conversation. It was more like just receiving this knowledge in a full block, or like being filled with it. The communication gave me the knowledge that it was difficult for him to be sort of tethered to this world because where he was was so glorious and full of joy that he just couldnt maintain a focus on my world anymoe. With that communication was delivered a sense or an experience of that glory and joy. I was overwhelmed with the thought of it. I woke up in tears for both what I had seen and also knowing that what I thought was an almost funny link to my deceased father that would go on for the rest of my life, was over.

379,OBE,1054,27,,F,"my consciousness popped out of my body and up over the SUV. I was floating about three feet above the roof. I could see the burgundy color, along with the four metal strips that were supposed to pass for a luggage rack. I took a greater interest in the lush trees and foliage to my right as the SUV continued along the bridge and the land dropped away. With just the slightest desire to have a closer look, I plunged over the side of the bridge and followed the tree line all the way down to the river, a considerable drop of 876 feet. I could see every leaf, every detail. As I skimmed over the water, I could see every rock beneath its surface. Then I headed back up the other side, keeping pace with the SUV my body still resided in. I came along side the vehicle, but I was still curious about the landscape, so I willed myself to separate from the SUV and go off on my own. I had no fear of doing this. I did not feel any excitement or anxiety. I only felt peace, joy and fascination. As I continued to float along the tops of the trees, however, they began to change. They no longer looked like earthly trees. The greens became iridescent, billowing, undulating.

381,NDE,1388,54,,M,"Bam!  That had to be a plane, I thought to myself. Nothing else could possibly be moving that fast. The force of the impact had snapped the drivers seat off and I felt the car being catapulted forward. That in itself was alarming.  I had been traveling north on I-75 just north of Atlanta, GA and had just been readying to exit the North Marietta Loop traveling at about 60 mph when the impact from behind had occurred. Just a couple minutes prior I had seen some jets taking off from Dobbins Air Base. It wasnt a plane that hit me though. It was an uninsured 19 yr old driving an unregistered vehicle. Witness reports put his speed at over a 100 mph as he wove in and out of traffic coming up I-75.  The impact caused the back end of my car to jerk out to the right. The wheels on my Toyata Corolla seemed to grab the road surface. I could feel the car begin to turn over. I knew how fast I was going. I knew the car would be turning over and over in a wild tumble. It was without a doubt one of those entire life in a flash moments. There wasnt a lot of time for any lengthy reminiscing though.  Just two thoughts went through my mind. The first was a pondering why Divine Spirit had chosen this time for me. Wow, I really thought Ive learned a lot in this life. Im just at the point in life where I might be able to offer others something worthwhile. Why now?  The second thought was expressed in a spirit of surrendering, God, I really only have one request. Id really like to take all that Ive learned with me to my next life. Please dont require me to learn everything all over again. Reincarnation is something that Im completely familiar and comfortable with.  The car began to flip over. I could hear the metal shearing and the glass shattering all around me. I felt the tumbling effect. I felt like I was inside a long tunnel like whirlpool. In the center of that incredibly fast spinning darkness I saw a bright white light, warm like the sun, very quiet and very serene.  Total silence.  I opened my eyes. Cool, I thought. I made it through this and Im not even hurt! No pain at all!  Then I tried to move. Not so much as a finger responded. I was lying face down, head in the back seat, my feet somewhere up around the area of the steering wheel. A thumb was pressing hard against my nose and lip. I could see that it appeared, by its relative positioning, to be the thumb from my left hand, but it was my right thumb. I could also see that my right arm bent in an awkward position under my throat. God, Im glad Im paralyzed because that would really hurt if I could feel it, I said to myself.  Totally paralyzed, I thought to myself. Quadriplegic. I will be a burden on everyone for the rest of my life.  I then concluded that because I was unable to feel any pain, that I probably had serious internal injuries as well. I would die here, but at least I would die without pain. I thanked Divine Spirit for that blessing.  I could literally feel myself, as Spirit, sinking slowly down and out of my body. It was a deeply sickening feeling. Then I heart a tapping sound. Are you all right? a womans trembling voice asked.  Im paralyzed. Call the police, call the ambulance. I said. At least I could talk, I thought to myself.  That started a flurry of activity. Over the next half hour, I heard sirens, people yelling and screaming, and the unmistakable sound of a helicopter. All the while I laid face down, head in the back seat, not moving. All the doors were jammed. The parameds were frantically trying to reach me and couldnt. They kept saying, Stay with us now, stay with us. They ended up cutting off the entire roof of the car and very carefully they lifted me out. I was placed on a stretcher, moved to level ground, and was immediately given an IV.  At least 5 or 6 medical personal surrounded me. The one directly above my face said to me, Mr., youre going to be all right. Then a womans voice said, Mr., have you made arrangements for organ transplants?  Yeah, I said. Its on my drivers license. I could see the guy directly above me stare down the lady who said it.  Then another voice spoke up. Mr, do you have a living will?  No, I said. I looked up at the guy above me and said, Im in it pretty deep, huh?  He smiled down at me and said Id be fine. Yeah, right, I thought to myself.  They strapped me in the lifeflight helicopter. Off I went to the Atlanta Medical Center Spinal Trauma Unit, the best such facility for hundreds of miles in all directions. Upon arriving I was placed in the operating room recovery room. Apparently there was more room there for all the medical personnel to gather round me.  After being taken for CAT Scans and an MRI I was returned to the recovery room.

The experience was tearing, painful beyond words, also due the feeling of being abandoned in the hospice with my dad by the rest of the family, who I felt like they just wanted to get it done and over with. I have never felt more lost, alone and helpless in my life and I could not understand how this could be happening to a loving person like my dad.

The experience must have lasted more than 20 seconds, but this is just a guess. As I turned around to go downstairs to ask for help my vision and the room went back to normal.

393,ME ,1545,62,,M,"I had just arrived at the hotel and decided to take a little nap, to rest after the driving. I left a lamp on, and lied on the bed, half turned to the right and fell asleep. It was a light and pleasant sleep and I awoke after about half an hour. As I opened my eyes, I saw a kind of steam or smoke rising from me. It was more like enveloping me, because as I was still half-turned to the right I saw it was rising from below the side of the bed. It was rising fast, as fast as steam does from a boiling pan of water, but more smoothly. I observed this and the next instant I became a little anxious, because I remembered that something like a haze rises sometimes from people who are dying. So I immediately breathed in and checked my body mentally, but I was fine. But by then I could not see the steam any more.

I experienced him as though he was in his 20s vibrant,strong, full head of hair, but with the persona of when he died in his 80s. The last one I had was the one that had the most dramatic influence on my spiritual life. He communicated with me about something mundane again I actually dont recall the issue now. But after that communication, he told me that he would not be communicating with me anymore. I cant say that it was like a conversation. It was more like just receiving this knowledge in a full block, or like being filled with it. The communication gave me the knowledge that it was difficult for him to be sort of tethered to this world because where he was was so glorious and full of joy that he just couldnt maintain a focus on my world anymoe. With that communication was delivered a sense or an experience of that glory and joy. I was overwhelmed with the thought of it. I woke up in tears for both what I had seen and also knowing that what I thought was an almost funny link to my deceased father that would go on for the rest of my life, was over.

One of the s&#233;ance trumpets was in front of my daughter but far enough away that she could not tip it over. She was seated in a chair, in the middle of the cabinet. After chanting, I heard something in the cabinet. It sounded like feet shuffling. Then, the trumpet tipped over. I got scared! I asked Mychael what he was doing and he told me it was not him. He was sitting in his chair the entire time and no one else could have possibly entered the space. He told me he thought an Ascended Master was trying to use the trumpet to talk to us! I began to shake! I have never been near anything like this. I am open-minded but full of old dogma from the JW religion. All my fears came up. I was scared but stayed silent. Soon, I felt the curtain on the cabinet brush across my foot. Mychael and I were sitting just outside the cabinet curtains so I would feel comfortable with my daughters training.

400,OBE,1341,66,,F,"I decided to take a Past-Life Workshop in the small, homey office of a hypnotist in Katonah, New York last year. Besides the hypnotist, another woman and myself were present. Before the session started, the pleasant hypnotist explained that she was going to hypnotize us. (I tried hypnosis one other time in my life but I couldnt be hypnotized. I thought, however, that I would try it again.) She said we would be going down a long flight of stairs. As we went down, we would be getting more and more tired. When we reached the bottom of the stairs, we would be hypnotized. Then she would direct us to go into a room where we would see who we were and where we were in our past life. It all sounded pretty okay, nothing scary. So, sitting in comfortable chairs, we closed our eyes and the leader directed us down a long flight of stairs. I remember the stairway was dark, but not frightening, and I was getting more and more tired. At the bottom of the stairs, she told us to open the door in front of us and go into the room but I saw a window opened and I flew out instead. I flew out into the dark universe. I wasnt in a spacecraft, it was just me flying. I remember just flying around in the darkness but not feeling afraid. I have a sensation that I was a young woman then, not my senior age at the time of this STE. I never actually heard anything. My experience was silent. I dont remember feeling cold or hot, but just right. I was wearing an ordinary set of clothes--pants and a top. I remember loving the experience of flying. I felt peaceful, serene and happy. I was flying alone, although I have a sense that my husband, Hank, was there from time to time. I remember seeing faraway stars and planets but I didnt land on anything. I was in heaven, in more ways than one. At some point I became aware that I was struggling to do something--waking up. I didnt want to leave the universe, I was enjoying flying so much, but I was awakening to my present human reality in the hypnotists office. When I awoke, the other woman was already awake. The hypnotist asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said I was having a hard time waking up. She thought I fell asleep but I told her I wasnt sleeping. The other woman talked about her experience and then I talked about my flying experience. The woman and hypnotist didnt say anything while I was describing my OBE. The session ended pretty much there. I remember feeling strange about being in this strange world on Earth. I wasnt sure I was okay enough to go out into the street and drive my car home, but I was. I can still feel myself flying in the dark universe, feeling peaceful and happy. I hope that, when Im on my deathbed, I am able to call upon this feeling when it is my time to pass on into Eternity.

403,ADC,1173,34,,F,"Sunday morning at a local antique car show with my family I was overcome by a message in my head from a grandmotherly voice. You can eat less, you will still be fed. You dont have to fear not being fed, it is a different time now. I knew pretty quickly that the message was for the intuitive. However, I did not want to pass on the message. As a psychiatrist I was keenly aware that such a message could be exceedingly destructive to a person with a history of an eating disorder. I resisted the STE...this only made the message louder and more difficult to ignore. It repeated not only in my head but in my body, insistent. I felt myself becoming rapidly ill. My body ached as though I had the flu. Within 30 minutes I had to leave my family at the antique care show and go home. At home I tried vainly to ignore the pounding message and sleep to no avail. Finally in desperation I said aloud okay, already, Ill tell her. I sent the intuitive an email explaining the situation and while I had extreme doubts about the social moire and the professional impropriety of my action, as soon as I sent the email I was flooded with relief. The flu-like symptoms and the message vanished. I crawled to bed and slept deeply for several hours until my family returned (as I have never done before.) It was several days before the intuitive finally contacted me and told me that she had prayed to her grandmother the friday before I met her asking desperately for help with her weight gain. The intuitive was perplexed that she normally receives insights for her clients, yet here was a straight-laced ivy league educated physician being contacted by her grandmother with literally the answer to her prayers. When I saw the same intuitive two years later for a brief ten minutes, she revealed that the message had quite literally changed her life.

404,OBE,1133,39,,M,"The night before I had this experience was a very emotional point in my life, the world seemed so terribly unjust and cruel that I was at a breaking point, that evening when arriving home walking from my car to the front door I paused to look up into the star filled sky with tears rolling down my cheeks quietly cried Why, why, why? I could not understand how the complete innocents of this world could be treated so terribly, how children could suffer so unjustly under the hand of others. I cried to sky as the universe because I could not believe in a God and had little faith in anything spiritual, if any.  Since rejecting the belief in God at the age of about 22, I did not believe such a thing could exist, because any such God which would allow these kinds of things to happen wasnt any kind of God to me. I couldnt pray to the concept of God but the universe was real, the immense out there, the all that is was something I could pour out my heart to without needing a belief in God. That night I gave the heavens my full heart seeking an answer to that question, with all my heart tearfully pleading for the answer. The next afternoon I received an answer to that question; since we are all a part of one another we do it to ourselves.  Although the answer didnt completely make up for all of the pain, much of the edge of that pain was taken off by finally being able to understand why such terrible things could happen to others in our world, to simply understand we have the freedom of choice to do such things because in the wider perspective the reality is we are all one and in that hurting no one else other than ourselves. Because of this and this alone we are allowed the freedom to do good or evil, if we werent really one I do not believe the spiritual heart of life would allow such to occur, call that center God, the conscious collective, the collective soul or what ever name you might choose. I finally came to understand, in the end we all pay the price for any wrong as well as reap the reward for any good and this took away much of the anger I had against reality for allowing terrible things to happen to good people.  The following is how the answer came to me through a dream-vision which was the most lucid moment of my life before or since but I must also add the following; the experience and my conclusions from it are my own made from who I am as a individual and how I saw the experience. Was it really God on high I met? I thought it was but beyond my own belief I cannot say it was, perhaps I met a collective soul which was so wonderful to me I thought it was God when in fact God might be levels above, so to speak,.   The Vision: Meeting a Sun-Intelligence-God. Sun of Souls~Souls of Sun; One Spirit~One Life.  Note: This experience was no doubt individually viewed through my own shade of colored glasses, limited to my own ability to understand things at the time, how I needed to be shown who we really are. This may have been brought on by severe apnea, a problem I had where I could stop breathing for long periods of time. I believe I may have stopped breathing for far too long that afternoon and had come close to death producing this NDE-like experience. I dont really know if this was a OOBE or due to apnea, but either way, what ever caused the experience it deeply impacted my outlook on life, what and who we really are.  One warm afternoon in 1996 I took a short nap and unexpectedly awoke within my slumber to find myself in a vast void in the presence of a huge sun or sphere of light, quickly coming to the understanding that this sun was pure conscious awareness. I was completely surprised to find myself so fully conscious in this empty but light-filled void which I knew to be more real than waking reality, in this place feeling super-conscious beyond anything I had experienced before. Although the light was without any kind of visual hint of facial features, I strongly sensed it smiling nothing but love for me and through those feelings knowing an unseen face.  While in the presence of this light I immediately and fully felt it peering deeply into my own awareness, lovingly knowing everything about me all at once. Feeling such love coming from this light I suddenly came to an awareness that this sun was God! I was so overwhelmed and surprised that God was real that I mentally gasped and then yelled out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Real!\xe2\x80\x9d. Just prior to this experience I had a deep mistrust of religion and rejected the concept of any kind of God or creator, much less the idea there was any continuation for human beings beyond our physical lives. Years before this experience, I had decided for many seemingly valid reasons that religion and God were only a product of the human mind, yet there I was standing in the presence of what I knew without a doubt wa",,USA    Q.,"25,000",agnostic,atheist,Christian,Christian,,,dail,never,very strong,littl,"50,000 99",Did not,Satelli,,marri,single,Yes,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

407,ME ,1294,61,,F,"During the summer of 2006, Hank and I were at an outdoor party at a swim club in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. We had met this group of people the year before, so they were new to us. It was a sunny day and I was talking to a very suntanned man everyone called Mike the Painter, to distinguish him, I suppose, from all the other Mikes. While I was talking to Mike, his whole face suddenly turned a deathly gray color. It happened in a snap, as if you turned on a light and boom! I guess it was shocking to see because my brain took a couple of seconds before I realized that his face had changed to gray. His face was gray for several seconds and then it snapped back to his normal tan color. I stood there staring at him. I dont remember what he was saying. I do not drink or do drugs. After that happened and in the next day or two, I remember thinking about Mikes face and wondering if it did indeed turn gray. I couldnt believe I saw his whole face a gray color. I tried to disbelieve this experience had happened to me. I tried to deny that his face had turned gray. But every time I tried to deny it, I kept affirming that I did indeed see that Mikes face instantly turned gray, stayed gray for several seconds, then instantly turned back to tan. Since Im a visual person and a visual artist, I couldnt deny that I saw his face was gray because my mind sort of takes a picture of it and, also, I was able to call it up in my memory and I would see it again, so I couldnt really deny the gray color. I ended up believing that this happened, even if I didnt understand why it happened or why I saw it. A day or two later I understood what I saw and why I saw it. Mike was a heavy smoker. He was usually smoking a cigarette whenever I saw him. I believed that God wanted me to warn Mike to stop smoking or hell pass at a young age. I waited a whole year before I got up the courage to tell Mike. I didnt want this new group of friends to think I was a religious zealot or crazy. So that summer I went up to Mike and told him what I saw and that I was meant to pass this warning to him. I apologized if he thought I was a zealot but Mike stopped me and said he was Catholic and believed that people see signs from God. He said he wasnt going to stop smoking and thanked me for telling him. I saw Mike every summer for a few years after that time and noticed that he was still smoking. Hank and I have since changed our summer plans so I dont expect to see Mike at that location again.

410,ME ,1478,46,,M,"This life changing event happened to me the latter part of October 2004  For many years I\xe2\x80\x99d been searching for a closer walk with God and financial success. My library of books and tapes are very extensive. I have read many books over twice and listened to tapes and CD\xe2\x80\x99s over and over and over again. I\xe2\x80\x99d started this learning process about 5 years ago and for the last three years I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten very serious about it. So much so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t read the paper, I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch the news on TV and my TV time is limited to almost nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve rented about 5 movies in the last five years. No movie theaters and I\xe2\x80\x99d recently turned off the car radio of any type of media or learning material and just thought positive thoughts while driving. The books that I read are the Bible, books on how our minds work, books on Personal Development and Spirituality. However I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe that the Spirit world existed So one day I have no Idea how I got there but I\xe2\x80\x99m on the website of a well known Success coach and trainer. On her site an interesting book catches my eye. I order the book and it arrives quickly. I start reading the book and it makes allot of sense. About a third way through the book I come upon a passage that says \xe2\x80\x9cOk, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to now tell you about my 5 agreements in business not to be confused with the Four Agreements of Don Miguel Ruiz. If you want to learn about his four agreements you can get his book titled the Four Agreements and read about them\xe2\x80\x9d.  Nothing else was mentioned about that subject and I kept reading. About 3 pages after that statement I felt compelled to go back. I found the author and the title of the book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Four Agreements\xe2\x80\x9d. I was sitting at my desk in front of my computer so I went to Ebay and clicked on a Buy It Now and had the book in my hand three day\xe2\x80\x99s later. I thought it came to me very quickly. The book is written I am told, at a sixth grade level and it has about 140 pages. So I ate it up and read it in about 3 days. After reading it I thought to myself. This book makes so much sense. Just 4 agreements and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to memorize a bunch of affirmations and make sure that I find the right one to say for the situation in my stack of 3X5\xe2\x80\x99 cards. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking this is one of the best books I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and it\xe2\x80\x99s so simple to understand and implement. So I go in for round two with this book. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read it again. About half way through the book is when it happens. My vision: It\xe2\x80\x99s 10:00am and I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting at my home office desk reading the book for the second time. The morning light is shining through my French doors. I\xe2\x80\x99m about half way through it when the room goes dark. I turn my chair to the left toward the light switch to see who\xe2\x80\x99s there. I stand and I drop the book to the floor out of my left hand. My desk is to my right.

The door and handle are illuminated like they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to explode and catch fire. I see smoke coming in from the door jam around the door frame on its out breath. I walk slowly to the door and grab the handle. I turn it clockwise and crack the door open about an inch to peak outside my room. An intense and bright white light comes through the one inch space.

418,DEE,1295,5,,F,"I was about 5 years old. I was going through emotional trauma because my parents were divorcing and my beloved father had suddenly, without warning to me, and permanently left our home, leaving me to fend for myself with my withdrawn, unaffectionate mother and my older sister who hated me. One day I was leaving our 6th floor apartment to visit a friendly neighbor. I opened the front door but I stood on the threshold and couldnt go any further. I looked down the long dark hallway but I couldnt take a step off the threshold and out onto the hallway floor. Even though I walked down this dark hallway many, many times before, on that day I couldnt move. I was physically paralyzed. I tried to turn around to go back into my house but I just stood there unable to move. I couldnt move in any direction. My mind wanted to move but I couldnt get my body to move. Then a strange thing happened. I saw an ethereal mist surround me in the shape of a cocoon and it began to wrap itself around me, starting at my feet, going up and stopping at my neck. My whole body, including my arms, was wrapped in this mummy-like cocoon. It made me feel safe, protected and warm. It calmed me down. Then I got an idea how to break out of the paralysis. I suddenly put out my arms and began to twirl off the threshold. I twirled and twirled all the way down the long hallway. I remember my twirling became a habit because I was twirling in my home, in the hallways and in the streets. I thought I was dancing. I think that people thought I was dancing. I feel that Holy Spirit came to me on that day to protect me and to help me.

420,PLR,1006,31,,F,"I was meditating, as I had done hundreds of times before. All of the sudden, I had an experience that felt like a past-life experience. First, you should know that I am a petite female (52, very slender). But in my meditation, all of the sudden I was sitting on a horse and it was sometime around the 10th or 12th century. I was a large man. I could feel my heft. I was wearing a helmet and some kind of armor and vest that had a chain design of some sort. It was heavy.  I had just returned from war. I was going home to my wife and children. I was sitting on my horse, on a hill, looking down at the house towards the right. It was a very long single story house that had a series of very small windows that ran horizontally across the house, and it had a dark roof that looked like it was made of straw or some textured material. It was a dark color and I could see lights from candles inside the house. I knew my wife and children were in there, waiting for my return. I sat and looked at the house and had a feeling of sadness. I was happy to be home but I felt that this life was so hard, war was so hard. It was just a feeling of life being a burden, and feeling sad about all of it. The house was down towards my right, below the hill, and if I looked to my left I could see a harbor which is where I had some from. There were boats. I remember that it was very cold. And I remember that I could feel my heft. Like I could actually feel what it felt like to be that large. I knew what the name of the harbor was. Then all of the sudden I was standing on something that is hard to describe it was like a wooden platform or large wood cart with wheels and it was being pulled by horses. I was standing on it and holding the reigns while the horses pulled this thing I was standing on. We were entering a castle. I worked at the castle. I was some kind of fighter.

422,NDE,1065,42,,M,"From an account I wrote for my family and friends in 2001. The big event happened one night while we were visiting the Oregon Coast. We had not planned to spend the night- but did at the last minute. The only available motel was an older place with horrible soft, old mattresses. From what I can figure out- halfway through the night, while kind of curled up against the wall, I slipped off the mattress, and got wedged between the wall and the mattress. I then had an apnea attack- and the inability to move, or breath, sent me into some state of cardiac failure. This is all conjecture, and only supported by the mild abnormality in my EKG over the past years since. Whether I coded or not, is really not at the heart of the issue or my experience. There are tons of debates regarding what really happens when you die by both medical and theological theorists worldwide. I can only relate what I experienced.  I admit that even as I write, it sounds like science fiction- but I can assure you that it happened- and I believe it to be real in every sense.  Without trying to be overly dramatic, the next events were what I have found to be in subsequent studies, a classic Near Death Experience. I did not see myself in bed (many report floating over their bodies), as the room was too dark- but I was blasted through an amazing tunnel (plasma? lights? not sure) of brightness that brought me ever closer to an unbelievable bright light. In what seemed like minutes (regular time does not seem to apply)- I arrived in a place that was so overwhelmingly bright and swimming with fluid colors of the entire spectrum, that I did not at first realize that I was without my physical body. While I could see- or at least had a sense of the vision that I was seeing- I could not see my hands. It was about this time that my experience was significantly different than others I have read about.  I realized what was happening, and I was not happy about it. Almost immediately, I started screaming, in a voice that I could hear in my head- but could not physically perceive- No f***ing way! (except there are no asterisks in heaven) NO! I am not finished yet! I still have young children- I have not seen my life through yet! NO Damn It!

I knew at that moment, two very clear truths to be real. First, I was not going to die yet (or stay dead if I was). Second, there was a God and an afterlife beyond our life on earth. Then things got strange, interesting and terrifying.  Unlike other NDE experiences I have read about, I did not see anyone, or feel the presence of Jesus, or Buddha, or Allah. Nor did I see a physical presence of any of my relatives that had passed before me- although I had a feeling that they were there with me.  What I did see was a much brighter place, perhaps 30-50- feet away (I had no real clear understanding of depth or ratio) that seemed almost to pull at my heart (if I had a heart) to come closer. I was awash with a complete feeling of peace, calm and contentment whenever I looked in the direction of this portal. And yet I knew, that moving into the portal would certainly mean that I would not be able to return to my life on earth.

Your need to know the truth about your life, is holding you back from living your life to the fullest.I agreed without speaking.

435,OBE,1341,66,,F,"I decided to take a Past-Life Workshop in the small, homey office of a hypnotist in Katonah, New York last year. Besides the hypnotist, another woman and myself were present. Before the session started, the pleasant hypnotist explained that she was going to hypnotize us. (I tried hypnosis one other time in my life but I couldnt be hypnotized. I thought, however, that I would try it again.) She said we would be going down a long flight of stairs. As we went down, we would be getting more and more tired. When we reached the bottom of the stairs, we would be hypnotized. Then she would direct us to go into a room where we would see who we were and where we were in our past life. It all sounded pretty okay, nothing scary. So, sitting in comfortable chairs, we closed our eyes and the leader directed us down a long flight of stairs. I remember the stairway was dark, but not frightening, and I was getting more and more tired. At the bottom of the stairs, she told us to open the door in front of us and go into the room but I saw a window opened and I flew out instead. I flew out into the dark universe. I wasnt in a spacecraft, it was just me flying. I remember just flying around in the darkness but not feeling afraid. I have a sensation that I was a young woman then, not my senior age at the time of this STE. I never actually heard anything. My experience was silent. I dont remember feeling cold or hot, but just right. I was wearing an ordinary set of clothes--pants and a top. I remember loving the experience of flying. I felt peaceful, serene and happy. I was flying alone, although I have a sense that my husband, Hank, was there from time to time. I remember seeing faraway stars and planets but I didnt land on anything. I was in heaven, in more ways than one. At some point I became aware that I was struggling to do something--waking up. I didnt want to leave the universe, I was enjoying flying so much, but I was awakening to my present human reality in the hypnotists office. When I awoke, the other woman was already awake. The hypnotist asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said I was having a hard time waking up. She thought I fell asleep but I told her I wasnt sleeping. The other woman talked about her experience and then I talked about my flying experience. The woman and hypnotist didnt say anything while I was describing my OBE. The session ended pretty much there. I remember feeling strange about being in this strange world on Earth. I wasnt sure I was okay enough to go out into the street and drive my car home, but I was. I can still feel myself flying in the dark universe, feeling peaceful and happy. I hope that, when Im on my deathbed, I am able to call upon this feeling when it is my time to pass on into Eternity.

436,DEE,1425,33,,M,"I awake to nothing. No body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space: no near, no far, no light or dark. No heat, no cold. No emotion: no joy, no fear. Just calm awareness in a gray void. A moment / eternity passes. Light! A brilliant sun! And with it, darkness: the fullness of empty space. A small human figure stands in silhouette. My consciousness shifts. I become the figure; a human body standing in space before a radiant globe. I feel! I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished. I become aware that what had first appeared like a sun is un-like anything from ordinary reality. I am in the presence of a radiant, fluid luminosity. An amalgam of water and light is the best approximation I can think of. The sense of being before a conscious presence intensifies. My mind buzzes with the desire to hold It, to explain and contain It with my thought. The more I grasp, however, the more It slips away. It cannot be grasped or named. I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away. I become light. I am one with the light. I am the light, a fluid, radiant luminosity. I have no body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light. A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body. A thought is expressed without words: approach your live with joy and gratitude; compassion and acceptance. A cosmic chuckle: clear-eyed and hard-nosed. I am laughed at/with. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take your self so seriously\xe2\x80\x9d rings in my mind. As I turn from the light a frigorific presence rushes from behind and past my left ear. It is a transparent nothingness consuming all energy in its path. It radiates a cold animus and an implacable will to be separate; to differentiate. As it rushes past an iron darkness warps around me. It fuses to me and I become dark and solid. I awake to an ordinary day.

437,DEE,1046,35,,M,"few weeks ago I had a powerful experience. I wouldnt call it a dream. I needed to write it down so I can remember the full intensity of the experience. Also to be able to reflect upon it, both now and in the future.        It has taken me sometime to get it all down; I have laboured to get every moment, every feeling, every thought that I had during it down on these pages- there was a lot to it. Its taken upwards of three weeks to get it all down completely. The experience started with a prayer to God I made the night previous. The prayer was; To show me a path out of my dilemma, and to show me how I got to be where I am now. I went to sleep that night and then I found myself in a familiar room from my past. I found myself in a spectacular room packed with Christmas presents, Christmas ornaments, and a Christmas tree. All unique in the fact that they were all composed of the same colours; black and silver. It was beautiful. It was breathtaking. It was simply astounding to be in the room.        I have a memory of being in that room, long, long ago, possibly even prior to my birth into this world. I remember being in the room and playing with many other children there, all of whom were equally astounded to be there. After playing for a while in this room the adults there began to give away Christmas presents to all of the children. I received my FIRST Christmas present there. I watched, as the other children opened their boxes and they received all kinds of toys, exquisite clothing and other gifts that were extraordinary to be sure, but I chose to wait till the end of the presentations to get my box towards the last. At my turn to receive a gift, what I found inside my box was a small floating glowing crystal.  The adults there asked me if I wanted it. I remember looking at it with intense curiosity. It shone brightly in silver, and then would fade to black- but even then when it was completely black, you could still discern that it was a beautiful crystal. Then after awhile it would lighten, it would become black for a while and then it would become somewhat silver, and then fade back some then again silver and then again black. Sometimes completely black and sometimes brightly silver. Some of the other children had received this type of crystal, as well, in their first Christmas presents. All of the crystals were similar, but each shone and faded at different intervals and for different periods of time. I examined some of the other lucky childrens crystals, some shone brightly silver most of the time, others would shine and then fade at regular intervals, others were erratic- shining and fading at seemingly random intervals. All were beautiful and all looked extremely fragile. All of the other kids who had not received a crystal were jealous of what the lucky children had received. It was like they had not passed some type of a test of character and they were not yet ready for this type of a gift. Again, the adults there in the room with me expressed some doubt, and asked me if I wanted my present? Again I looked and compared my crystal with what the other lucky children had, my crystal with this second look seemed somehow defective. My crystal had long periods where it would be completely dark, several periods where it would be between dark and light, and very short periods where it would shine brighter than any of the other crystals. Then it occurred to me that this wasnt a defective crystal at all, but in fact, a unique crystal that was completely different from any of the others that I had seen. I said yes- I wanted my present, and this present, this present of this oddly glowing and fading crystal was actually the gift of a life in this world. I got my life out of it. The other lucky children got their lives out of their crystals as well, each life different from the next.        This time, now, that I was in the room, everything was the same except there were no other children here. I was equally astounded to be in this meticulously decorated room and yet, I had a sense that I didnt want any of it. That it was just a memory from long ago, and that having matured to middle age- I didnt want any of it anymore. It was like the passing of a stage. How many of the other children had settled for the shiny wrappers and the electric thrills, ornamental clothing and toys, and I, like a few other lucky ones, had waited till the last and received the most precious gift of all- a life, and now I didnt want mine anymore!  And from here I felt I had passed a stage into another room up above the room I had been in. I was lifted up on a strange device that swung me back and forth, gradually upwards towards this other room further up above. This next room was an empty schoolroom, barren and empty except for a freshly shiny-waxed floor and a man in what appeared to be a secu",,Canadian,"251,00",agnostic,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,very strong,moder,"25,000 49",some,Truck d,,marri,marri,Yes,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

452,ME ,1294,61,,F,"During the summer of 2006, Hank and I were at an outdoor party at a swim club in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. We had met this group of people the year before, so they were new to us. It was a sunny day and I was talking to a very suntanned man everyone called Mike the Painter, to distinguish him, I suppose, from all the other Mikes. While I was talking to Mike, his whole face suddenly turned a deathly gray color. It happened in a snap, as if you turned on a light and boom! I guess it was shocking to see because my brain took a couple of seconds before I realized that his face had changed to gray. His face was gray for several seconds and then it snapped back to his normal tan color. I stood there staring at him. I dont remember what he was saying. I do not drink or do drugs. After that happened and in the next day or two, I remember thinking about Mikes face and wondering if it did indeed turn gray. I couldnt believe I saw his whole face a gray color. I tried to disbelieve this experience had happened to me. I tried to deny that his face had turned gray. But every time I tried to deny it, I kept affirming that I did indeed see that Mikes face instantly turned gray, stayed gray for several seconds, then instantly turned back to tan. Since Im a visual person and a visual artist, I couldnt deny that I saw his face was gray because my mind sort of takes a picture of it and, also, I was able to call it up in my memory and I would see it again, so I couldnt really deny the gray color. I ended up believing that this happened, even if I didnt understand why it happened or why I saw it. A day or two later I understood what I saw and why I saw it. Mike was a heavy smoker. He was usually smoking a cigarette whenever I saw him. I believed that God wanted me to warn Mike to stop smoking or hell pass at a young age. I waited a whole year before I got up the courage to tell Mike. I didnt want this new group of friends to think I was a religious zealot or crazy. So that summer I went up to Mike and told him what I saw and that I was meant to pass this warning to him. I apologized if he thought I was a zealot but Mike stopped me and said he was Catholic and believed that people see signs from God. He said he wasnt going to stop smoking and thanked me for telling him. I saw Mike every summer for a few years after that time and noticed that he was still smoking. Hank and I have since changed our summer plans so I dont expect to see Mike at that location again.

I forced myself to look to the left to try to ascertain where I was. In between the aperture blades I could see I was in outer space. I saw a black sky all around with stars. When I turned to move forward again I could see in the distance what appeared to be the end of the tunnel. It was made up of a beige inflatable cushion-type structure. I quickly moved forward to reach the end. I was greeted by an elder angelic-like spirit who began asking me questions almost to verify my identity.

We turned in the direction of the rolling hills again and this time I saw many people all dressed in white silently walking in the right direction. I did not know these people or where they were going. He suggested we sit at a concrete garden table to the left with 2 concrete benches on either side. Beyond the table I noticed a one-story concrete building with no windows or doors that I could see. My father wanted to know how I was and said he was concerned about me. At the time, I was undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer (DCIS ductal carcinoma in situ, stage 0). I reassured him there was no need for concern as the radiation wasnt bothering me at all and the DCIS was not ever fatal. He told me he was very proud of me. After a time, He asked me to come around the table to where he was sitting so I could give him a hug goodbye. As I did, he asked me to forgive him. The encounter was pleasant up to that point. When he asked me to forgive him, all my memories of how he had been a strict disciplinarian came back to me and I started to feel badly, reliving those feelings I had as a child and teenager.

460,ME ,1009,18,,F,"One of the weirdest things about this experience was the feeling of getting shot in the head. Actually, I didnt feel a thing, but I remember how my vision exploded in red. I remember how I vaguely felt my body hitting the ground and being unable to stop it, even as I, as a spirit, got yanked out of my body. I didnt feel a bit of pain, and Im usually very scared of blood, but I wasnt scared of the blood I saw coming out of me as I died--just intrigued, but not emotionally connected to it. As a spirit, I learned that I look very different than how I look physically. This experience taught me that I, Theresa, am actually a combination of three women who I was in other lifetimes--and I learned that we dont have to live our lifetimes in chronological order, and those lifetimes can overlap on each other, too. I learned that I, Theresa, am a combination of these three women:-a German Jewish girl who was about sixteen when she died in one of the concentration camps during the Holocaust-an American (Caucasian) woman who was in her 30s when she died in the 1980s-a Caucasian woman with shoulder-length, flaming red hair who was the captain of a starship and had died in the 2300s or thereabouts. She was in her late 20s-early 30s. Id lived all three of these lifetimes before this one. I learned that I, Theresa, am a composite of all three of these women. Im not exactly my own person. Im unique, yes--but I was created from these three women. Looking back on whats happened in the 2000s in our physical world, Im astounded that I basically saw our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan several years before they happened. Back in 1998, it was a lot easier to dismiss this experience as some really vivid dream, emphasis on dream. When I was 18, I couldnt fathom circumstances when the US would choose to wage war against anyone else. It was really easy to dismiss this aspect of my experience as something out of an action movie, perhaps. And I distinctly felt what the other soldiers were feeling--this grief over the fact that they knew, at the time of their deaths, that they would be dying so far away from home for a pointless war. The soldiers in my dream knew this full well as they died. They were extremely sad about this. If I had to describe it, it was like they had this immense, low, wailing grief--something very heavy and sad, like low, gray storm clouds. Back in 1998, one of the things that really amazed me was that the littlest promises we make are, indeed, kept. To go back to this brother of mine: We were fans of James Camerons movie, TITANIC, and we met in an email mailing list. We ended up talking a lot via IM. I dont think we ever exchanged pictures, even. But he was the first to say that he felt like I was his little sister, which was odd because he is an only child, like me. He liked calling me Sis a lot, and I called him big bro, although I dont think I felt this sibling bond quite as strongly as he did. We did talk about the supernatural, and about life beyond death. He talked about being in the US Army for some period of time. I dont know how our conversations got to this point, but we made a promise to each other: that if it really was true that there was life beyond death, whoever would die first would go to the other person and be there for them when it was their time to die. In the case of my experience, I died first and, as promised, I visited him--even if I, at least, had completely forgotten about making this promise in the first place.

467,DEE,1297,67,,F,"Hank, my husband, and I were getting ready to move on December 10, 2012 from Ossining, New York to Milford, Connecticut. Most of the house was already packed up. I had gone through the whole coat closet downstairs by the front door, throwing stuff out and organizing what I wanted to pack up at that time or wait until moving day. There was a small shelf above the coat hangar bar that I looked over while standing on a stool to see what was up there and what needed to be thrown out. There were mostly gloves and hats which I kept there in case we needed them. We had just arrived home at night from eating out Thanksgiving Dinner on November 22, 2012. Hank hung up his coat first in the lit up coat closet. Then I took out a hangar, hung my coat on it and, while looking toward Hank and talking to him, I went to hang up my coat without looking at the bar or what I was doing because I knew that closet so well, after living in this house for 22 years. I had trouble getting the hangar hook to go over the bar. I tried and tried but the hook wouldnt go on the bar. It kept getting stuck on something. So I looked at the bar and saw there was a chain of some kind hanging down from the shelf above. There was a sliver of an opening between the slats of the wooden shelf and a chain had made its way through the opening and hung down in a loop, the narrow opening of which happened to be facing the tip of the hangar. So when I aimed, without looking, the tip of the hangar to go on the bar, it went through the narrow loop instead and got stuck there. I looked at the chain. I couldnt understand where this chain came from. I knew everything that was on the shelf and there was no chain. I pulled on the chain. It came down through the slat opening and a medallion of some kind followed it. I looked at this medallion with its long neck chain in the palm of my hand and just stared at it. I couldnt believe my eyes. That was my medallion and my chain that I had mysteriously lost 5 years previous. I had this piece of jewelry custom made for me, based on the image that I had seen when I was 29 years of age of a glow and cross. The medallion was a white Mother of Pearl flat, round disk (glow) with a MOP cross affixed onto the disk. When I received this gift to myself from the jeweler, I loved it and wore it every single day for about a year. One night Hank and I were going to a special place and I wanted to wear a special necklace that would conflict with the medallion and chain, so I took it off and probably placed it on my dresser in the bedroom, as I was planning to wear it again the next day. I either placed it on the top of my dresser or put it into my jewelry drawer in the dresser. The next day when I awoke, I looked for the medallion to put it on again and I couldnt find it. I looked on the dresser top, in all the drawers, on the floor around the dresser, in our bedroom, in the bathrooms and in all the rooms of my home, but Hank and I couldnt find it. It was missing for about 5 years and during those years, I kept on looking all over my house for the medallion, but with no luck. Then I thought that God was mad at me for taking it off, so It took it away. So, 5 years later, God had miraculously given back to me my medallion in such an incredible way. I showed it to Hank in disbelief. He was amazed how that medallion came back to me, and 5 years later! Then I told Hank that I had a bad thought, that It gave it back to me because something bad or hard was going to happen during or after our move and I would need this medallion that I loved so much and which connected me to God and Its serenity. Ive been wearing the medallion every day since and will wear it every single day always, even if it doesnt go with a fancy outfit. Our move was hard but Hank and I survived it and are doing well. Although we have to move again in a year and dont know where we will live, though we want to stay in Milford.

468,OBE,1373,39,,F,"I copy here the experience exactly as I typed it then. This records my third experience. The first one occurred in February of 1984 and then August, 1984. The third one in January of 1985, as written.  Jan.26, 1985--it has happened again (On what I experienced in early morning, only half awake). There was a rushing sound, a roaring in my ears. I am half awake now, with consciousness of my surroundings, and also have the feeling I am about to plunge off a cliff, a falling sensation. I feel, just briefly, a sense of immovability--the way in a dream one tries to move and cant, and also a sense of fear arises at this. Then the images begin, the feeling one of plunging deep into a vortex, but everything is vividly clear, in color. The images are against a black background, and they are perfect crystalline forms, changing constantly, that make me think of snowflake forms at times, then of those theoretical models of chemical components or DNA, and then of pure rock crystal forms. The speed of the images is way beyond me, their transformations occurring without cessation. Nothing exists but this silent world I seem to have entered, as the forms recede and accelerate alternately in the darkness. Then they stop--disappear, and what I see at a vast distance in total blackness, as if I were looking through a telescope backwards, only infinitely smaller than that, is a tiny circle of light. I see it as if I am looking into a cauldron of light, barely glimpsed at such a distance, but it shifts and flickers on the edges. Only a tiny part of it is revealed to me, but the light is so clear it is like the interior of a diamond--a dazzling light, that oddly conveys a sense, for which I cannot account, that it has a knowledge of some sort--as if the light was source. Then a tingling feeling occurs and the image ends--it all goes away, and I sense my regular surroundings again. I try to go to sleep. The first time this happened, last February 84, I was scared silly.  The images occurred after I experienced the same roaring sound, but at that time (also an early hour, between 2 and 5 a.m.) there was also a loud cracking sound; in fact, that happened first. The images were, then, not immediately visible. They appeared finally in the center of a deep blackness at a great distance in a curling, churning fire of light, and accelerated toward me until I could see the swirling changing crystal forms. I stayed up an hour afterwards, writing it down. I felt then the same tingling sensation at the onset and end of the event, and the same moment of immovability. The second time (all told, it has happened three times) was last summer, August, 84. And now this one, around 4:30 or 5 a.m. The fear was briefer; I knew more of what to expect, and it was as if I willed myself to hold on. I had been asleep, wake up to the buzzing, electric sensation, and the rest, and then it begins. I let the images come. In the times between the 3 events Ive tried to make it happen, unsuccessfully. Each time has occurred only spontaneously. Each time I feel I have encountered something with great energy or power within it. I feel it will happen again--that there is more to learn. Especially within that light. It frightens me, yet I sense it has meaning, validity. I wonder at its meaning, and seek it out.

469,OBE,1524,21,,F,So I was sitting upright and looking at the end of the bed where I felt a presence not one person but a group of people. I actually could not see these people they did not reveal themselves. I saw an outline like an aura white and thin foggy. Someone said to me telepathically come over. I hesitated scared I remember and said Im not ready. Then snap I was lying down again and opened my eyes. The room was exactly how I saw it through them closed other than the beings were gone. I felt like I knew these people intimately more than the people I know in this world even though I couldnt see them I sensed they were close to me like family like my real family. I felt I could trust them but that I hadnt completed my purposes on earth yet. I was in effect asking for more time.

475,NDE,1117,30,,M,"I was walking along a road. It was not paved, but a gravel path, very nicely maintained with beautiful flowers along the sides. The road started in a valley and went up a hill towards a very beautiful mansion or palace with a gate in front of it. It was far off in the distance from where I began to walk, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say how far exactly. On either side of the road, the land sloped away sharply, like going off a cliff, so if one fell off the road, one would land in a deep, dark pit. From the pit one could hear sounds of agony, wailing, and lamenting from human beings who were down there. Some tried to claw their way up and grab at me on the road, but I knew they could not actually reach me. I was a little afraid at first, as I knew this to be the pit of hell. The road was not narrow, however, so there was no danger of me falling off the road. I began walking towards the gate, all the while the lost souls wailing until I got near to the gate. Close to the gate, they were no longer around. The mansion was very beautiful. The whole environment was other-worldly, somehow glittering and radiant. I knew I was on another plane, no longer on Earth. I could hear the gentle music of stringed instruments in the background, very soothing and lovely. Eventually I started nearing the gate of the mansion or palace. The mansion was actually quite far from the gate, but one could see radiant beings behind the gate going about their daily activities. Some were carrying baskets with flowers and all were going about their daily routine. There was complete unity and love there, unlike the way people on Earth behave. It was serene and peaceful, just a wonderful place, and I really wanted so much to go inside. There were four winged angels guarding the gate on the outside, two on each side, and as I approached, they moved together and crossed their arms, blocking my entry. They were radiant beings, clearly not human. They were so very kind, but were not going to let me in, although they did not say anything to that effect. There was so much joy and peace there, I tried to get by them, when a group of beings from inside approached the gate to talk to me. An elderly \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d (not a human being) with white hair spoke to me. Although he was right in front of me, his voice sounded like he was very, very far away. It was almost like I was hearing an echo of something said in the distance. He said I would be there at a point in time, but not yet, that my mission was incomplete and that I still had a lot more to accomplish. He was very kind and spoke gently to me, absolutely convincing me that I could not get in. Until this moment, I had really not thought about anything relating to my earthly life, although I knew who I was. I was dressed as I was the day of the accident. When he told me that I could not enter, only then did I start to try to think about what had really happened to me and what was going on. I thought it odd that I was the only person around and there were no dogs or other animals. As I was considering all this, I left that place. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I actually regained consciousness at that precise moment, but I suspect I did. I did not recognize any people whom I knew previously who had died. I also did not know any of the people in the pit.

480,ADC,1434,45,,F,"Wish you were here. (a poem) You would love this place Dad, this forest mountain trail meandering past turquoise glacier lakes, cutting across a steep treeless loose-gravel scree. The path turns to switchback up a bare-dirt shoulder smoothed by winter\xe2\x80\x99s snow melting. At the crest, suddenly the view opens up expansive, to all horizons like the Swiss Alps. The whole Cascade range is carved at my feet: vivid green chasms, peaks painted white, no hint of civilization.  A pure sky of small cotton ball clouds streams from the horizon directly toward me, and I have to brace against this wild steady wind that spurs an endless herd of white stallions. Suddenly close and larger when leaping over this ridge, they tuck their legs at the last minute, skirting these wind-braced gnarled trees and my hand stretching up.  I used to tag along on your weekend hikes to places like this, your sanctuary. Me scurrying behind with little legs, trying to keep up with your tall, long easy strides. Death is the mystery, but I can sense you here now, Dad, in the mountains. Forgiveness allows my heart to expand; love created this place and is greater than space and time.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t hike like you did, I mountain bike. I pick up my machine here to ride back down, put on a helmet and earbuds for my Ipod. Swooping down the trail weaving through banked turns, speed and reactions are too quick for thought: rocks, a few feet of air. Me and two wheels quietly carve turns around huge ancient cedars skyscraper tall, their wizened moss-bearded branches sleepily brush puffy mist above. A postcard-intense azure sky between their reddish-brown trunks. A rush flying weightless through adrenaline-fueled bliss, this is my cathedral.  As I ride, a favorite song by Incubus always makes me think of you. It has become my prayer, telling you I am ok now.

I signal them with my lighter   and in this moment i am happy,  I had a rare chance to visit your grave, passing through on my motorcycle. So many years ago this dot on a map, a hiccup in a straight flat line, was the stifling world I escaped at eighteen. Now its just a hot, dusty-small, freeway town. Surreally, everyone is a stranger. An earlier self\xe2\x80\x99s memories are just a story, gratefully too distant for emotions. The gravel road turns behind juvenile hall where I waited for my new foster mom after you died. The tiny catholic cemetery holds a few hundred family histories, a white, white statue, larger than life, divides two centuries. Mary, weeping, holds tortured Jesus in her lap. I know, neither one of us is Catholic, but mom was. I park the motorcycle. One key with one fob, a little silver disc etched with three lines one side, three broken lines the other; I-Ching symbols for Heaven and Earth.  Two unkempt, neglected yellow rose bushes grown mis-matched almost cover your name, so I trim a few branches. Ive never believed a spirit is buried, you are not here. But this is the last place on earth our paths intersected, so where else to go? No dates on the stone, I am sorry. I was too young to remember when the funeral home asked. But I am ok now.  You would be so proud of your beautiful granddaughters. The best of all of us, together.  You would like my husband, my soulmate. With him I\xe2\x80\x99ve surfed tropical waters with whales and turtles, biked Canadian passes, found love. Your spirit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to carry the burden of our grief anymore. I am no longer in a place of confused tears. Not even here. This sunny day.  Birds practice their songs above me, sitting back on an old tree; leaves quietly stirring sunbeams. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the Hispanic graves, decorated like a party. A family has recently left, spending a few happy hours with a beloved. Shiny balloons gently sway in the breeze.  Its a relief to share the peace we both so desperately needed so long ago. Then thoughts of the remaining day start to impede. A grocery list of errands, people to visit, hours on a clock, all interrupt me to leave. From the cool mowed grass I pick up my smartphone filled with facebook and emails, then in my hand the phone plays Wish You Were Here.  Dad. Are you telling me youre ok now too? I put the phone down to be here, a little while longer.  Love is greater than space and time.

481,ME ,1108,19,,F,"I was just riding the subway when, out of nowhere, Jesus appeared to me. It wasnt a visual appearance, but sort of in my minds eye, yet his presence was an absolute certainty to me and I could sense him very, very powerfully. He appeared to me as he is so often depicted in European paintings, with a flowing robe, long hair, and a beard but other than that he was in a place that was entirely dark. In other words, I just saw Jesus who was otherwise surrounded by blackness he was all that mattered at that moment. He spoke only once and asked a single question which I will never forget as long I as draw breathe. He asked me, Do you want me to show you how I love you? One would think that his appearance would have surprised me, but I just took it in stride and thought to myself, sure, what the heck, what have I got to lose? I was curious, so I immediately agreed, but I never said yes aloud, but somehow communicated directly and immediately. Jesus, whose arms had been at his side, wordlessly just opened his arms wide open and instantly something happened to me. Now, there are no human words to describe what I felt next. I had the sense of absolutely pure love being poured all over me from above, sort of like being baptized with pure love. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before it was not at all HUMAN love, but far more. There was no ulterior motive, no expectation, no string attached, just pure, altruistic, unadulterated love. I immediately started to just cry and I leaned my arm on the seat in front of me and hid my face so nobody could see me crying like that. (It was Christmas Day and the train was almost completely empty. The closest person to me was half a train car away from me.) The sensation was ineffable and I felt like the luckiest human being who had ever lived. I started asking Jesus questions like, Why are you showing this to me, Im unworthy, I dont deserve it. I repeated, There are people who have been religious all their lives and havent experienced this, they deserve it, not me. Things went on like this for some time, I have no idea how long. I can only say that the total ride time from where I got on to where I exited the train was about 50 minutes and the event did not start right away, but perhaps half-way through the journey. The love just kept flowing over me, but no answer to my questions came. At times, the love pouring over me and enveloping me seemed like water flowing, at another moment, it seemed like gold coins being poured over me and it just didnt end. Gradually, I stopped crying and stopped asking questions, I just relished it and continued to feel so very luck.  Eventually, I got off the train at my station. Im not sure how long I waited for my bus or if I even waited at all. The blissful state of being divinely loved took center stage and nothing else mattered at all to me. The bus took off and I started to cry again, again hiding from others. I re-asked my questions, but still no answers. Details of the bus ride are a little unclear, but I remember there was music, too. It started early in the experience and it was as if Jesus were singing a particular song to me, one that I had liked, but not thought much about.

483,ME ,1108,19,,F,"I was just riding the subway when, out of nowhere, Jesus appeared to me. It wasnt a visual appearance, but sort of in my minds eye, yet his presence was an absolute certainty to me and I could sense him very, very powerfully. He appeared to me as he is so often depicted in European paintings, with a flowing robe, long hair, and a beard but other than that he was in a place that was entirely dark. In other words, I just saw Jesus who was otherwise surrounded by blackness he was all that mattered at that moment. He spoke only once and asked a single question which I will never forget as long I as draw breathe. He asked me, Do you want me to show you how I love you? One would think that his appearance would have surprised me, but I just took it in stride and thought to myself, sure, what the heck, what have I got to lose? I was curious, so I immediately agreed, but I never said yes aloud, but somehow communicated directly and immediately. Jesus, whose arms had been at his side, wordlessly just opened his arms wide open and instantly something happened to me. Now, there are no human words to describe what I felt next. I had the sense of absolutely pure love being poured all over me from above, sort of like being baptized with pure love. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before it was not at all HUMAN love, but far more. There was no ulterior motive, no expectation, no string attached, just pure, altruistic, unadulterated love. I immediately started to just cry and I leaned my arm on the seat in front of me and hid my face so nobody could see me crying like that. (It was Christmas Day and the train was almost completely empty. The closest person to me was half a train car away from me.) The sensation was ineffable and I felt like the luckiest human being who had ever lived. I started asking Jesus questions like, Why are you showing this to me, Im unworthy, I dont deserve it. I repeated, There are people who have been religious all their lives and havent experienced this, they deserve it, not me. Things went on like this for some time, I have no idea how long. I can only say that the total ride time from where I got on to where I exited the train was about 50 minutes and the event did not start right away, but perhaps half-way through the journey. The love just kept flowing over me, but no answer to my questions came. At times, the love pouring over me and enveloping me seemed like water flowing, at another moment, it seemed like gold coins being poured over me and it just didnt end. Gradually, I stopped crying and stopped asking questions, I just relished it and continued to feel so very luck.  Eventually, I got off the train at my station. Im not sure how long I waited for my bus or if I even waited at all. The blissful state of being divinely loved took center stage and nothing else mattered at all to me. The bus took off and I started to cry again, again hiding from others. I re-asked my questions, but still no answers. Details of the bus ride are a little unclear, but I remember there was music, too. It started early in the experience and it was as if Jesus were singing a particular song to me, one that I had liked, but not thought much about.

485,OBE,1054,27,,F,"my consciousness popped out of my body and up over the SUV. I was floating about three feet above the roof. I could see the burgundy color, along with the four metal strips that were supposed to pass for a luggage rack. I took a greater interest in the lush trees and foliage to my right as the SUV continued along the bridge and the land dropped away. With just the slightest desire to have a closer look, I plunged over the side of the bridge and followed the tree line all the way down to the river, a considerable drop of 876 feet. I could see every leaf, every detail. As I skimmed over the water, I could see every rock beneath its surface. Then I headed back up the other side, keeping pace with the SUV my body still resided in. I came along side the vehicle, but I was still curious about the landscape, so I willed myself to separate from the SUV and go off on my own. I had no fear of doing this. I did not feel any excitement or anxiety. I only felt peace, joy and fascination. As I continued to float along the tops of the trees, however, they began to change.

488,ADC,1434,45,,F,"Wish you were here. (a poem) You would love this place Dad, this forest mountain trail meandering past turquoise glacier lakes, cutting across a steep treeless loose-gravel scree. The path turns to switchback up a bare-dirt shoulder smoothed by winter\xe2\x80\x99s snow melting. At the crest, suddenly the view opens up expansive, to all horizons like the Swiss Alps. The whole Cascade range is carved at my feet: vivid green chasms, peaks painted white, no hint of civilization.  A pure sky of small cotton ball clouds streams from the horizon directly toward me, and I have to brace against this wild steady wind that spurs an endless herd of white stallions. Suddenly close and larger when leaping over this ridge, they tuck their legs at the last minute, skirting these wind-braced gnarled trees and my hand stretching up.  I used to tag along on your weekend hikes to places like this, your sanctuary. Me scurrying behind with little legs, trying to keep up with your tall, long easy strides. Death is the mystery, but I can sense you here now, Dad, in the mountains. Forgiveness allows my heart to expand; love created this place and is greater than space and time.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t hike like you did, I mountain bike. I pick up my machine here to ride back down, put on a helmet and earbuds for my Ipod. Swooping down the trail weaving through banked turns, speed and reactions are too quick for thought: rocks, a few feet of air. Me and two wheels quietly carve turns around huge ancient cedars skyscraper tall, their wizened moss-bearded branches sleepily brush puffy mist above. A postcard-intense azure sky between their reddish-brown trunks. A rush flying weightless through adrenaline-fueled bliss, this is my cathedral.  As I ride, a favorite song by Incubus always makes me think of you. It has become my prayer, telling you I am ok now.   I dig my toes into the sand,   the ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket   I lean against the wind   Pretend that I am weightless   And in this moment I am happy.   I Wish You Were Here\xe2\x80\xa6.     I lay my head onto the sand.   The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it.   Im counting ufos.   I signal them with my lighter   and in this moment i am happy,  I had a rare chance to visit your grave, passing through on my motorcycle. So many years ago this dot on a map, a hiccup in a straight flat line, was the stifling world I escaped at eighteen. Now its just a hot, dusty-small, freeway town. Surreally, everyone is a stranger. An earlier self\xe2\x80\x99s memories are just a story, gratefully too distant for emotions. The gravel road turns behind juvenile hall where I waited for my new foster mom after you died. The tiny catholic cemetery holds a few hundred family histories, a white, white statue, larger than life, divides two centuries. Mary, weeping, holds tortured Jesus in her lap. I know, neither one of us is Catholic, but mom was. I park the motorcycle. One key with one fob, a little silver disc etched with three lines one side, three broken lines the other; I-Ching symbols for Heaven and Earth.  Two unkempt, neglected yellow rose bushes grown mis-matched almost cover your name, so I trim a few branches. Ive never believed a spirit is buried, you are not here. But this is the last place on earth our paths intersected, so where else to go? No dates on the stone, I am sorry. I was too young to remember when the funeral home asked. But I am ok now.  You would be so proud of your beautiful granddaughters. The best of all of us, together.  You would like my husband, my soulmate. With him I\xe2\x80\x99ve surfed tropical waters with whales and turtles, biked Canadian passes, found love. Your spirit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to carry the burden of our grief anymore. I am no longer in a place of confused tears. Not even here. This sunny day.  Birds practice their songs above me, sitting back on an old tree; leaves quietly stirring sunbeams. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the Hispanic graves, decorated like a party. A family has recently left, spending a few happy hours with a beloved. Shiny balloons gently sway in the breeze.  Its a relief to share the peace we both so desperately needed so long ago. Then thoughts of the remaining day start to impede. A grocery list of errands, people to visit, hours on a clock, all interrupt me to leave. From the cool mowed grass I pick up my smartphone filled with facebook and emails, then in my hand the phone plays Wish You Were Here.  Dad. Are you telling me youre ok now too?

489,DEE,1062,39,,F,"My first memory after the surgery was awakening in a very dark room and I was completely worn out from being cold. I was still shivering and all I could think about was being warm again. I was in a warming-type tube that was pumping hot air to warm me up. I have no idea of the time or how long I was drifting in and out of sleep. As I was lying there freezing &amp; shivering, I clearly remember that while my eyes were closed the light came on in the room. Instantly I was warm. I remember thinking, oh wow, I am finally warm. I was so relaxed and relieved to not be shivering. I was literally lying there basking in this warm light feeling so wonderful! At some point my logical side asked the question of who turned on the light? When I opened my eyes the entire room was filled with a brilliant light. What I remember very well was that this light although very bright, did not hurt my eyes. The light was beautiful, peaceful, pure. It is difficult to have the proper adjectives to describe this light. At some point I began looking around the room. Sitting at the foot of my bed was the figure of a man. I could not see his face as the light appeared to be radiating from behind Him. I knew without a doubt that this man was someone very important and spiritual. I felt no fear and had complete understanding at the time that I was in the presence of someone from heaven. Without speaking the way we do here on earth, He spoke to me. He said 4 very clear sentences to me. 1. You are going to be alright. 2. I have work for you to do. (I then asked, What kind of work? I will do anything.) 3. In My own time. 4. Now rest my child. It seemed that within a few seconds after the final message, the light went away and I immediately began shivering again and was cold.  I glanced over at my sleeping husband and said, did you see him? He looked at me as if I were crazy. I remember thinking that I had dreamt this but it was so very real, so physical and so peaceful. I was unable to really talk about this experience for a very long time. When I was able to share it, it was very, very emotional for me. I felt unworthy of this visit. Why me?  I also felt a profound peace concerning death. I knew without a shadow of a doubt that what I experienced was real and that when I did die, I would be going to a wonderful place where I would always be warm.

493,NDA,1386,17,,F,"One night, I had a dream. I remember being outside of my grandfather house. Outside of the house was my grandfather. He approached me, and we were happy to see each other. I knew it had been a while since I saw him. And, I also knew that she was currently sick and afraid of him leaving me [to the afterlife]. My grandfather took my hand, and we walked into his house. The view inside the house, during the dream, was identical to his real house. What I found unusual was that all the lights were out except the one straight ahead- his room.  As we proceeded to walk towards his room, he was telling me that things were going to be fine. That, at first, things were going to feel like they are spinning out of control. As if I was standing with my arms out, spinning in circles, losing my balance- THAT type of loss of control. Although I found comfort in his words, I didnt know what he actually meant, until after his death.  When we approached the bedroom door, I could not believe my eyes. In front of me, was a hospital bed and my grandfather was in it! My grandfather was in his bed, facing my direction; he was asleep. Behind him, sitting, was his 2nd wife, his daughter, Lucy, and his son, Danny. To my left [and my grandfathers], sitting on a chair, was my mother. All of them were looking straight at my grandfather. I could not believe that I was in the presence of two grandfathers- and the same one!!  Seeing my grandfather in the hospital bed created a magnetic pull. I could not remove my eyes from him. I had never seen him in such a state. He was always alert, active, and immediately greeting me. This was the first time that I ever saw him so disconnected from everyone else, especially in their presence.  Seeing that there was an empty chair right next to his bed, I immediately sat on it. I felt I was trying to be close to him as I possibly could. This was the man I had loved all my life. He was my father, my comfort, and my strength. I admired this man profusely. And, knowing that I had denied seeing him for so many months, he needed to know I was finally there.  I apologized to him for not being there for when he needed me the most. I told him I was scared of losing him and I was scared that he would pass away once he already saw me. (He had seen every family member, but me. Due to how our relationship was, my withdrawal had shocked everyone. I thought you loved your grandfather, why arent you seeing him? You know that he is dying. Go see him.) Once I finished venting to my grandfather, asking him for forgiveness, his eyes opened. He looked at me. I returned the look. And he closed them again. Right then I knew that I was right. He WAS waiting for me. He wasnt leaving yet because we hadnt said goodbye. And I was the last person that he needed to see. But, I knew that I wasnt ready to let him go. Feeling overwhelmed, I reached out to him. I went for his hand and I grabbed it. It was my first touch with him in months. And once I held his hand, I heard his last breath. I was then informed he died. Everyone around was crying, including myself. With the pain of a broken heart, and having everything feel so real, I immediately woke up from my dream. I woke up sweating and bursting into tears. I could not stop crying. I had felt as if my grandfather had truly passed away.  My mother, who was sleeping next to me at the time (she didnt want to be alone during this moment in her life- being a daddys girl) woke up with fright. She didnt know what happened to me. I relived the dream by telling her every single detail. She reached out to a relative who informed her that my grandfather was still alive. - Exactly one week later, still fearful of my dream, and still avoiding seeing my dying grandfather, my mom informed me that she had just seen my grandfather. She informed me that now it was just a matter of hours or minutes. Without thinking, I immediately got ready. It was probably 10:00-11:00 at night. On my way over there, those fears werent present. But once I walked up to my grandfathers door- all my fears came flooding back. I did not know what to expect. Was my dream just a dream? Or, would it become a reality?? As my mother and I walked in through the door. My heart slumped to the bottom of my stomach. Just like my dream- the house was dark except for the back room- my grandfathers room. I began to experience anxiety. I was praying my steps towards the room would be nothing like my dream. I had so much hope in those few seconds which felt like an hour. When I walked into the bedroom, there he was: my grandfather laying on a bed, facing my direction. Behind him, my 2nd wife, my aunt Lucy, and my uncle Danny. My mother took a seat to my left.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that I\xe2\x80\x99m not still scared, but what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were to tell everyone they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be scared, if I were too afraid to put my head above the parapet and risk being shot at? Before I had my \xe2\x80\x98experience\xe2\x80\x99 I knew nothing about spirituality, and even less about religion. So what happened was as incredulous to me as what you are going to read may sound to you! I have, however, always had good intuition and a kind of underlying \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 since childhood that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching for something that was missing, like I always knew there was another dimension even though society and my education told me otherwise. I was about 12 when I read the book \xe2\x80\x98Utopia\xe2\x80\x99 and to me it was more than just fiction, it was a possibility. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t just think it\xe2\x80\x99s achievable; I know how. It all happened when I had started to meditate at the same time as thinking more deeply about what to be \xe2\x80\x98mentally ill\xe2\x80\x99 actually means. I\xe2\x80\x99d worked within the field for long enough to know about academic theory; the nature / nurture argument and chemical imbalances. What was the truth? I started to question my own sanity, I have always been very sensitive and emotional; where do you draw the line? I am well aware that by writing this, that by voicing my beliefs that I have channelled a message from the spiritual realm, I could be seen by some working within the mental health field as being deluded or having experienced a psychotic episode. You may choose to believe that this is the rambling of an unstable mind, you may suggest that what I am saying is insane. I, however, now know that the real insanity would be for me to ignore such an important message. If I were to ignore it and deny myself my truth for fear of speaking out against a system, I know that I would become mentally distressed \xe2\x80\x93 and that is also proof enough for me to know that the message I have been given is the truth. Many people who try to speak out about their psychic experiences are told that what they are experiencing is not real; that they are \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99. So either way, if somebody has a spiritual experience they are more than likely doomed to some form of mental distress, predominantly not from the experience itself, but from either repressing it due to fear, or from believing they are going \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99 if they do dare to speak out because they are told that what is happening to them isn\xe2\x80\x99t real. The message I was given confirmed all of this. So I had been contemplating the true nature of mental illness, and whether indeed I was mentally unwell, and my brain went into overload so I decided I needed to try to relax.

I thought that was odd, as all the lights in our apartment were turned off and my husband was asleep in the living room. I sat up in bed to get a closer look when I saw two images very clearly displayed on the hallway wall, which appeared in the center of that dim light. They were two shadows, one in the shape of a butterfly and one in the shape of a dove. They were quite detailed. The butterfly, for example, had the veins in its wings prominently outlined as if it were made of stained glass- but it was a shadow, in black and white. The dove also appeared to resemble an image you might see on stained glass, only black and white. I sat up further and spoke out loud to myself: I am awake. This is real. What I am seeing is real... Then, the butterflys wings began to move and it flew up the wall and to the ceiling, where it disappeared. Next, the doves wings began to flutter, and it also moved up toward the ceiling and disappeared. I had the intense impression that this was a sign that I had moved in a positive spiritual direction that day, by having that talk earlier with my husband in which I opened up about myself.

It was more like just receiving this knowledge in a full block, or like being filled with it. The communication gave me the knowledge that it was difficult for him to be sort of tethered to this world because where he was was so glorious and full of joy that he just couldnt maintain a focus on my world anymoe. With that communication was delivered a sense or an experience of that glory and joy. I was overwhelmed with the thought of it.

507,ME ,1462,23,,M,"Floating in an erect and body as light air: As I was walking, I became aware of a strangely subtle force coming over me. I felt a kind of vibration starting to run up through my body. It was soft at first, then became more pronounced as time went on. I felt the top of my head being pulled straight up while at the same time, my hips were being pulled downward into the earth. It felt as though I was being supported by a bolt of energy that literally ran through my body. The energy expanded from above me and from down below at the same time. My posture became very straight and It felt as though I was floating and weightless within it. I was surprised at how effortless it was to be so light and erect. It reminded me of the description a Tai Chi teacher once gave me of how to stand correctly, as if heaven were pulling me upwards by the top of my head and earth pulling me downwards from somewhere near the prostrate.  Effortless Breathing  Breathing became deep, light and effortless. I found myself witnessing each breath without the experience of guilt or anxiety resisting each in or exhale. All the usual tension in my solar plexus, tightness in my diagram and tension in my lungs had vanished. Breathing became a brand new experience for me, where I was able to take very satisfying and refreshing breaths.I marveled at what was happening to me, It felt wonderful to feel so free and light on the earth in my body. After time it occurred to me that this experience surely couldnt last very long because it felt so wonderful. I waited a while to see if it would leave. I waited for the familiar tension, anxiety, the heaviness of the body and breath to return. After a very short time, I let go and allowed the wonderful experience to guide me. Where did the mind go? As I surrendered more to the experience I became aware that thoughts werent being created on the fly, I had them, but I was creating them when needed and by choice, by powerful choice, they werent free floating and coming out of no where and they certainly werent attacking me. It was like the experiences of floating lightly within my body that had a very erect posture or breathing unburdened by guilt, anxiety, depression, anger, self hatred, self judgement. Now I was experiencing emptiness where 100s of thoughts per seconds should have been. The triad of experiences was connected together and created a sense of great joy, understanding and freedom. Freeing because I had always known myself to be what my thoughts told me I was, and here, those thoughts not existing at all, it was a beautiful realization that I still lived on without them. With the mind being opaque, its opinions laid to rest, the veil of ignorance lifted and laid bare, the truth stood squarely in my face, It was awe inspiring it was beautiful, it was more than joyful. There was no doubt about It. It became clear to me that the mind was not all powerful, all knowing or omnipotent, but rather a mirage that wasnt there when looked at from the side of truth. The truth not only showed what the I was part of, bliss, freedom, love, oneness with all, but at the same time, what I have never been; body, guilty and deserving of punishment, hatred, shame, terror and death. The mind was impotent and could not stand its ground when directly facing the truth. Experiencing truth was the most joyous, romantic and blissful experience. I was free from the slavery of illusion, free to experience the reality of my being, free to love and be loved solely because I was.  How could my past vanish without sins being accounted for? I pondered the implications of how such a ferociously powerful mind grasping into every part of my being every second of my life could have been tossed aside into non existence so matter of faculty. All that I had known myself to be was born out of the abuse and abandonment by my parents. Guilt, anxiety, self hatred, fear\xe2\x80\xa6 they had been my family in the absence of a family, all gone in a flash. How could it be that all sins were forgiven just like that as if thered never been a past me? What did this mean about my reality? Then it occurred to me, for the first time in my life, I was awake. I had never experienced being awake like this. By realizing that I was awake, I could see how I had been dreaming. Truth was showing me that the mind had been lulling me into an non ending dream state with all of its endless thoughts. I had simply awoken from a dream of guilt and shame, terror and death and saw that I had been dreaming. Being able to tell the difference between a dream and being awake is the truth, it is everything, all doubt vanishes. It is easy to tell one has been dreaming when one is awake and therefor no the difference between dreaming and experiencing the truth.

511,OBE,1371,26,,M,"What I observed, felt and saw were the most real things I ever experienced. As I slept, I didnt just float away I shot off like a rocket. I was going warp speed with a destination pre-programmed. I didnt know consciously where I was headed, I just knew I was going. It was very much the sensation of flying through space. It was dark like space, but I dont remember darkness. I do recall zooming past worlds, orbs really, not planets in the physical sense, but worlds nonetheless, near and far. I traveled at this warp speed what I could sense was a vast distance, multitudes beyond what we even have measurements for. When I came out of my travels, I found myself in the presence of these two men as described above.  And HERE is the most remarkable, profound, and intense part of this experience: Despite their important work of apparently saving a large population, when I arrived there, they both turned their full attention to me. Here, words truly lose their meaning. I have great reverence for these two men and the work they were seemingly doing, yet despite this they afforded me their full attention and admiration and love. They were happy to see ME! But it was so much more than that. I felt all of the infinite and unconditional love of the universe, the acceptance, everything Dr. Eben discussed in his book, if I may use that cop-out in lieu of attempting to describe the indescribable.  At the time, I had been dealing with being disrespected as a new EMT in a culture that big on attitude and tradition and small on respect. I learned one of the most important lessons of my life in that moment: That every being on earth is greeted with %1,000 full attention, love, admiration, and acceptance by God, with no regard to anything else thats going on. I cant fathom how its possible to everywhere and doing everything at once, despite the fact that I experienced beings capable of that while making me the center and sole focus of all that infinite love.  I clumsily and, I feel, stupidly introduced myself as Josh, from Oregon, as though that would have made sense. It did, apparently. As we all floated above this world with refugees down below, information was exchanged. There was a discussion. I do not recall nor did I upon waking- that discussion that was shared between the three of us. I was there to experience what I had upon my arrival. My mother, whom I was best friends with, died in 2002. My family was shattered, but I was the apple of my mothers eye. Her death is something that I still havent dealt with fully. I sense that this was at the heart of that exchange, however it was with some other part of me that I dont have access to right now.  When this conversation concluded, whatever it was, I remember making the journey back to my body. It was the exact same immeasurable distance, yet the time it took was very... well, there was no quick or slow about it. It just was. When I arrived back to my body, I snapped awake.  I immediately called my father who had been close friends with Pir Vilayat. My dad was very supportive and receptive, even happy that I had such a special dream.

524,ME ,1366,34,,F,"I was sitting under a tree and began to think the tree was conscious. Shortly thereafter I felt I was being contacted by my deceased father who said he was worried about the fact that my mother still smoked. (He died of lung cancer in 1981). After a day another entity took my fathers place. He said his name was Thieliel and that he was a Greek scribe who had been captured by the Assyrians and forced into service. I got a flash of him falling to his death from a tower and some pages of strange script. He said that as a suicide he had chosen to spend some time in the afterlife as a guide to prevent the suicide of someone else.  After this encounter, for several days the world seemed to get darker and more threatening, like, physically. My husband wanted to put me in a mental hospital and I feared Id never see my children again. At the worst of it I said a common Catholic prayer--at that point, I was hearing terrible suffering and was aware of this inky blackness. As soon as I said the prayer, whoosh! right out the top of my head into the Light. The Light was 1) timeless, 2) all knowing, 3) perfect love. I was part of it, yet myself also. I saw in this state that time as we know it is an illusion and that love and knowledge cannot be separated.

He had passed away approximately ten years earlier and I had always said that I couldnt believe how much I missed him, even so many years after his death. This was my first loss and I took his death very hard because he had always been my father figure- my birth father had never been around (and died when I was 5), AND my relationship with my adoptive father was not close at all. Some specific details of the dream were not clear such as where we were or in what capacity my grandfather came to me, but I do remember that in the dream, I was very aware that it was impossible (in my understanding) for him to be there, communicating with me. My response in the dream was basically, How can this be, you are dead? I dont believe he said much to me, but I was so excited to have this time with him and I remember wanting to introduce him to my life since his death. I had no kids when he died and I wasnt married although I was dating my now husband. So, in the dream, I was feverishly trying to catch him up on all the events of my life...getting married, having two beautiful kids, going to university to become a teacher. I wanted him to be proud of me and I wanted so desperately to keep him around and involved in my life.  When I woke up, I truly felt that I had really lived this dream...a feeling I had never had with a dream and I remember wanting to cry because it was so real and vivid and now that I was awake, I couldnt get it back.

The intensity of the LOVE and the LIGHT flowing from this MAGNIFICENT BEING was beyond what my mind could grasp. I couldnt look at it, I turned my face slightly away, although this was all happening within me, I turned it slightly away because what I was seeing and what I was experiencing stunned my human mind, stunned it because the beauty of it, the transcendence of it and the LOVE itself was beyond human imagination.

The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there.

Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God.

In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

553,ME ,1287,57,,F,"On January 12, 2002 something pivotal happened that enabled me to open my mind to believe in God. My husband Hank and I were staying at a historic, antique-filled bed and breakfast, Butternut Farm, in Glastonbury, Connecticut. (I dont think the owners of this establishment would want it to be made public that their bed and breakfast is haunted.) It was Saturday night and we went to sleep on the comfortable and luxurious bed. In the middle of the night, I woke up, eyes wide open, and sat up tall in bed. Looking back on this experience, I must have looked like I was in one of those movies when someone is under a spell and rises from their sleep with their eyes wide open, back straight as a board. I didnt hear or smell anything and I wasnt touched by anything but I instantly turned my head to the left and saw something. About three feet away from me, suspended in mid air about eye level to me, was a ghost. The ghost was shaped like a huge, round, horizontal Bayer aspirin tablet. It was flat on the top and bottom with rounded edges. It was about two feet in diameter. The ghost was made up of thousands of tiny black particles, each shaped like a sperm, which furiously rotated clockwise as fast as a tornado. It spun around so violently that it spewed off some of the tiny black particles. But, although the ghost was just a couple of feet away and although it was spinning as fast as a tornado, I didnt feel a breeze and none of the particles touched me. It was as if the ghost was contained in its own little world, separate from my human world. This whole experience actually lasted just a few seconds, because as soon as I sat up and turned my head and my eyes saw the ghost, as if it saw me looking at it, it instantly broke down into an amoebic mob of black particles and made a mad dash for the closed old door and disappeared through the long crack of the warped frame. I sat up for a while thinking about this experience. Strangely, I did not feel fear because if I did, I would have awakened my husband. I did feel a sort of fear because I didnt want to put my head back down on the pillow, afraid to go back to sleep, afraid the ghost would return. But I was very tired and layed back down to ponder what I should do. The next thing I knew, it was morning. As soon as we woke up, I told Hank about the ghost. He just listened to me. He looked like he was believing me. I told him there probably was a small chance it was all a dream but I didnt think so. It didnt feel like a dream. It felt real and I remembered it in vivid detail. When we went downstairs for breakfast, I was so excited that I told everyone in the dining room what happened to me that night. The two owners mockingly pooh-poohed my story but there was a visiting pastor from Pennsylvania. She also stayed overnight because she was to give a sermon at a nearby church. She confirmed that she was also visited by the ghost. She said she didnt see what I saw but she woke up during the night and felt its presence sitting in a chair by her bed. She said that in her line of work, people often came to her with stories and issues concerning ghosts and spirits. With the pastor as witness, I was validated 100% that I did indeed see a ghost. Actually, I think this pastor was an Angel because in the days ahead I tried to reach her but I couldnt find her anywhere, even though she gave me her business card. It was as if she disappeared. Seeing the ghost was a shocking but crucial experience. It had served a greater purpose in my life than just to amaze me. It took about a year for me to digest and process the ghost before I could tell anyone else. Then I told a friend. After getting this experience out, I started to really think about the ghost. It suddenly dawned on me that I saw a ghost! The reality of seeing a ghost, I realized, became proof that there really was a spiritual world. Standing now on the threshold of this whole new world, my mind looked out and wondered: Wow! Now that I know there really is a spiritual world and that ghosts are real, what else can I believe in? The answer came in my very next breath: God. But, still, I didnt find God for another year. And on that day, everything became crystal clear.

561,DEE,1177,43,,F,"After hanging up the phone with my younger sister, I said out loud that as a family we could not endure another experience with cancer. My father had died of a glioblastoma at age 54 in 1978. I prayed with concern over my sisters initial test results and began to cry uncontrollably. Very suddenly, I began to feel an exceptionally warm energy burning beneath my stomach but above my abdomen. This warm energy began slowly traveling up through the center of my body. By the time it entered my head, I had received knowledge that my sisters test results would turn out to show a benign condition. I cant describe how I knew this, but I was 100% certain that that would be the outcome and I had received this knowledge from some knowing entity. At the same time this was happening to me, my cat in the hallway started showing very peculiar behavior. He was standing on 3 legs with one of his front legs in the air a position Ive never seen a cat take. In addition, he seemed to be in a trance. When I called his name, he could not hear me. His head was moving slowly from side to side, left to right, like he was transfixed by some image. I looked in the direction of his gaze and saw nothing but darkness. He stayed in this position with these movements for several minutes in a trance-like state. After this was all over for him and me, I phoned my sister back and told her of my experience and told her she had absolutely nothing to worry about concerning the tests she was to take the next day and that I was phoning her now so the next day when she had the tests she would have proof of the truthfulness of my experience.

562,OBE,1142,27,,F,"I suddenly found myself out of my body looking at myself on the couch sleeping, I walked around the apartment and kept referring back to myself on the couch just to check for security for some reason it was comforting to know I was there even if I wasnt completely inside of myself any longer. I went into the bathroom in this spirit form and saw a great statue perched on the closed toilet seat that looked like a statue but I didnt realize it was the angel of death but either way I didnt feel any fear from it. I saw some mini creatures that were about 2-3 feet in size going into the drain of the bathtub happily and willingly and as the approached the drain they would spin as if being flushed and I could see this great release on their faces and wanted to experience that same release too. So I decided to follow them and the moment I willingly resigned my soul for it to be permitted to be flushed down the bathtub drain I felt for the first time complete separation of myself from something that had always been with me but because I had never been without it I didnt know I had always had it...that was this connection to God. It was only in that vortex that I immediately knew I had made a mistake by stepping into that bathtub drain and called out to God and asked him to take me back to my body on the couch over and over but the tunnel vortex thing I was in spinning inside of and going deeper felt so isolated and I felt so alone and felt that my pleading and cries couldnt even be heard from God. Then the angel I had seen perched on top of the toilet next to the bathtub swooped down and caught me as I was decending in the vortex and I began to justify myself to God asking why would you permit the angel of death to personally escort me to Hell I am not a bad person? I didnt know God had heard my cries finally I saw myself ascending through the floor boards of my apartment and the angel just rolled my spirit like a basketball down the angels arms and back into my body exactly as I was when I left it on the couch.

564,OBE,1371,26,,M,"What I observed, felt and saw were the most real things I ever experienced. As I slept, I didnt just float away I shot off like a rocket. I was going warp speed with a destination pre-programmed. I didnt know consciously where I was headed, I just knew I was going. It was very much the sensation of flying through space. It was dark like space, but I dont remember darkness. I do recall zooming past worlds, orbs really, not planets in the physical sense, but worlds nonetheless, near and far. I traveled at this warp speed what I could sense was a vast distance, multitudes beyond what we even have measurements for. When I came out of my travels, I found myself in the presence of these two men as described above.  And HERE is the most remarkable, profound, and intense part of this experience: Despite their important work of apparently saving a large population, when I arrived there, they both turned their full attention to me. Here, words truly lose their meaning. I have great reverence for these two men and the work they were seemingly doing, yet despite this they afforded me their full attention and admiration and love. They were happy to see ME! But it was so much more than that. I felt all of the infinite and unconditional love of the universe, the acceptance, everything Dr. Eben discussed in his book, if I may use that cop-out in lieu of attempting to describe the indescribable.  At the time, I had been dealing with being disrespected as a new EMT in a culture that big on attitude and tradition and small on respect. I learned one of the most important lessons of my life in that moment: That every being on earth is greeted with %1,000 full attention, love, admiration, and acceptance by God, with no regard to anything else thats going on. I cant fathom how its possible to everywhere and doing everything at once, despite the fact that I experienced beings capable of that while making me the center and sole focus of all that infinite love.  I clumsily and, I feel, stupidly introduced myself as Josh, from Oregon, as though that would have made sense. It did, apparently. As we all floated above this world with refugees down below, information was exchanged. There was a discussion. I do not recall nor did I upon waking- that discussion that was shared between the three of us. I was there to experience what I had upon my arrival. My mother, whom I was best friends with, died in 2002. My family was shattered, but I was the apple of my mothers eye. Her death is something that I still havent dealt with fully. I sense that this was at the heart of that exchange, however it was with some other part of me that I dont have access to right now.  When this conversation concluded, whatever it was, I remember making the journey back to my body. It was the exact same immeasurable distance, yet the time it took was very... well, there was no quick or slow about it. It just was. When I arrived back to my body, I snapped awake.  I immediately called my father who had been close friends with Pir Vilayat. My dad was very supportive and receptive, even happy that I had such a special dream.

565,NDE,1276,45,,M,"My first memories was a sense of unnatural sounds like the building itself was breathing or living somehow. I saw through the walls to a room that I knew was on another dimension or in a spiritual plane. In this room, men sat and leaned against the walls while they waited. I knew somehow that they were waiting to escort the dead to another place. I knew that I was close to death in this moment and that was the reason I could see them. I was not afraid. I just knew it.  My next memory was of a village setting that looked medieval or European. The streets were cobble stone and the buildings were stone as well. People walked in groups down the road. I think a better description would be that they wondered aimlessly. They looked straight ahead, slightly downward and seemed to be without hope. I had an overwhelming feeling of gloom in this place and I felt as though they were being punished or detained in some way.  The thing that was MOST striking about these visions was there absolute vividness. It was as though I was seeing them with the most high definition TV ever seen. I could not explain how powerful this sense of visual clarity was. It was as though it were more real than real life. Even though these people seemed as though they were not supposed to look at me, occasionally one would lock eyes with me for just a moment. They had such despair in their eyes that it saddened me to make eye contact.  Later I was in this same place in a large arena, though that is not really the right word. It was a place in a large building that had a circular path that came in one door and passed in front of what seemed to be stadium type seating.  I had a feeling that people were paraded through this place in the lines I had seen them walking in on the streets to possibly be judged or reviewed in some way. Again, the architecture was like nothing I have seen here in the states. It seemed very old and mostly made from stone.  My next and final memory was my defining moment where I was like a speck dust floating in a space that felt like a large room. I was exactly like those particles of dust that you see floating randomly in the open space of a room as the sunlight passes through a window. I was free, floating on an invisible river of air through this space, around a tree or plant, feeling sheer joy and amazement. I had no identity in these moments. I had no memory of anything personal or earthly. I only knew that I was truly at peace. I was one with the universe, completely accepted, and loved. I felt such joy in those brief moments that it makes my heart race even now as I recall it. As I passed through this space, I saw a very obvious ray of what I thought was sunshine coming downward from the right from no obvious window or light source. I didnt question anything, but I remember a sense of really hoping that I would drift through this light. As I did enter the light, I felt happiness like I have never known. I felt as though anything I had known before this moment was infantile and insignificant. I knew this was the presence of God, though I did not see a face. I dont even know that I had the ability to look at the source of the light. I just basked in its glory.  I saw flashes or arcs of light zipping above me. They looked like just that really, but I felt like they were something bigger than me, something more than I could even try to understand. Later, I remembered seeing a phenomenon called flying rods that I have seen myself in videos that I have where these things that are not visible to the naked eye show up on high speed video and they appear to swim through the sky with multiple wings on a straight translucent body.  I wonder if these could be what I saw in this place. As far as I know this phenomenon is not explained scientifically yet, but you can find hundreds or thousands of video accounts on youtube by searching for flying rods. I may be nothing, but then again...  I had a number of very substantial things that became known to me in this place. For one, the reason that everyone describes these visions as being so vivid is that we are not looking at them with our failing human eyes. We are seeing them in a supernatural state of being where our tired old eyeballs could not even begin to compare. Also, I became acutely aware that I am a being inside of a being. I felt that I am a spirit aside from the conscious brain thought, which I always thought was ME. Suddenly, I had all of these memories of things like driving on long trips when I am complete zoned out in deep thought, yet somehow my body is driving the car, slowing and speeding up in traffic, using turn signals, and yet I arrive 30 miles later not remembering the drive.

I need PROOF that he is OKAY! And just as I shouted this at God a sudden loud bang and flash of white light filled the bedroom. Shawn and I physically jumped out of bed because the crash was so loud we thought the window was going to crash in on us. We looked at each other, puzzled. Was that for us?

572,DEE,1046,35,,M,"few weeks ago I had a powerful experience. I wouldnt call it a dream. I needed to write it down so I can remember the full intensity of the experience. Also to be able to reflect upon it, both now and in the future.        It has taken me sometime to get it all down; I have laboured to get every moment, every feeling, every thought that I had during it down on these pages- there was a lot to it. Its taken upwards of three weeks to get it all down completely. The experience started with a prayer to God I made the night previous. The prayer was; To show me a path out of my dilemma, and to show me how I got to be where I am now. I went to sleep that night and then I found myself in a familiar room from my past. I found myself in a spectacular room packed with Christmas presents, Christmas ornaments, and a Christmas tree. All unique in the fact that they were all composed of the same colours; black and silver. It was beautiful. It was breathtaking. It was simply astounding to be in the room.        I have a memory of being in that room, long, long ago, possibly even prior to my birth into this world. I remember being in the room and playing with many other children there, all of whom were equally astounded to be there. After playing for a while in this room the adults there began to give away Christmas presents to all of the children. I received my FIRST Christmas present there. I watched, as the other children opened their boxes and they received all kinds of toys, exquisite clothing and other gifts that were extraordinary to be sure, but I chose to wait till the end of the presentations to get my box towards the last. At my turn to receive a gift, what I found inside my box was a small floating glowing crystal.  The adults there asked me if I wanted it. I remember looking at it with intense curiosity. It shone brightly in silver, and then would fade to black- but even then when it was completely black, you could still discern that it was a beautiful crystal. Then after awhile it would lighten, it would become black for a while and then it would become somewhat silver, and then fade back some then again silver and then again black. Sometimes completely black and sometimes brightly silver. Some of the other children had received this type of crystal, as well, in their first Christmas presents. All of the crystals were similar, but each shone and faded at different intervals and for different periods of time. I examined some of the other lucky childrens crystals, some shone brightly silver most of the time, others would shine and then fade at regular intervals, others were erratic- shining and fading at seemingly random intervals. All were beautiful and all looked extremely fragile. All of the other kids who had not received a crystal were jealous of what the lucky children had received. It was like they had not passed some type of a test of character and they were not yet ready for this type of a gift. Again, the adults there in the room with me expressed some doubt, and asked me if I wanted my present? Again I looked and compared my crystal with what the other lucky children had, my crystal with this second look seemed somehow defective. My crystal had long periods where it would be completely dark, several periods where it would be between dark and light, and very short periods where it would shine brighter than any of the other crystals. Then it occurred to me that this wasnt a defective crystal at all, but in fact, a unique crystal that was completely different from any of the others that I had seen. I said yes- I wanted my present, and this present, this present of this oddly glowing and fading crystal was actually the gift of a life in this world. I got my life out of it. The other lucky children got their lives out of their crystals as well, each life different from the next.        This time, now, that I was in the room, everything was the same except there were no other children here. I was equally astounded to be in this meticulously decorated room and yet, I had a sense that I didnt want any of it. That it was just a memory from long ago, and that having matured to middle age- I didnt want any of it anymore. It was like the passing of a stage. How many of the other children had settled for the shiny wrappers and the electric thrills, ornamental clothing and toys, and I, like a few other lucky ones, had waited till the last and received the most precious gift of all- a life, and now I didnt want mine anymore!  And from here I felt I had passed a stage into another room up above the room I had been in. I was lifted up on a strange device that swung me back and forth, gradually upwards towards this other room further up above. This next room was an empty schoolroom, barren and empty except for a freshly shiny-waxed floor and a man in what appeared to be a secu",,Canadian,"251,00",agnostic,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,very strong,moder,"25,000 49",some,Truck d,,marri,marri,Yes,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

My sight of these things was shortly focused on something else, as I saw a tall, black, shadowy figure standing right in front of me. I was frozen with fear as obviously this sort of thing doesnt happen everyday for me.. So I just stood there looking at it. It seemed malevolent. I just had this feeling that it knew I was scared of it, and that was an achieved goal for the figure or something, and it slowly started to walk (move, float) towards me.

575,ME ,1108,19,,F,"I was just riding the subway when, out of nowhere, Jesus appeared to me. It wasnt a visual appearance, but sort of in my minds eye, yet his presence was an absolute certainty to me and I could sense him very, very powerfully. He appeared to me as he is so often depicted in European paintings, with a flowing robe, long hair, and a beard but other than that he was in a place that was entirely dark. In other words, I just saw Jesus who was otherwise surrounded by blackness he was all that mattered at that moment. He spoke only once and asked a single question which I will never forget as long I as draw breathe. He asked me, Do you want me to show you how I love you? One would think that his appearance would have surprised me, but I just took it in stride and thought to myself, sure, what the heck, what have I got to lose? I was curious, so I immediately agreed, but I never said yes aloud, but somehow communicated directly and immediately. Jesus, whose arms had been at his side, wordlessly just opened his arms wide open and instantly something happened to me. Now, there are no human words to describe what I felt next. I had the sense of absolutely pure love being poured all over me from above, sort of like being baptized with pure love. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before it was not at all HUMAN love, but far more. There was no ulterior motive, no expectation, no string attached, just pure, altruistic, unadulterated love. I immediately started to just cry and I leaned my arm on the seat in front of me and hid my face so nobody could see me crying like that. (It was Christmas Day and the train was almost completely empty. The closest person to me was half a train car away from me.) The sensation was ineffable and I felt like the luckiest human being who had ever lived. I started asking Jesus questions like, Why are you showing this to me, Im unworthy, I dont deserve it. I repeated, There are people who have been religious all their lives and havent experienced this, they deserve it, not me. Things went on like this for some time, I have no idea how long. I can only say that the total ride time from where I got on to where I exited the train was about 50 minutes and the event did not start right away, but perhaps half-way through the journey. The love just kept flowing over me, but no answer to my questions came. At times, the love pouring over me and enveloping me seemed like water flowing, at another moment, it seemed like gold coins being poured over me and it just didnt end. Gradually, I stopped crying and stopped asking questions, I just relished it and continued to feel so very luck.  Eventually, I got off the train at my station. Im not sure how long I waited for my bus or if I even waited at all. The blissful state of being divinely loved took center stage and nothing else mattered at all to me. The bus took off and I started to cry again, again hiding from others. I re-asked my questions, but still no answers. Details of the bus ride are a little unclear, but I remember there was music, too. It started early in the experience and it was as if Jesus were singing a particular song to me, one that I had liked, but not thought much about. It was a popular song from the late 60s sung by Petula Clark called My Love is Warmer than the Sunshine. It was repeating constantly in my mind, as if it were Jesus trying to find an analogy that would resonate with me. Ive copied the lyrics that just kept repeating in my mind. As I heard them sung with Petulas voice, but Jesus intentions, I thought deeply about each line and could really FEEL it somehow. They were no longer just silly lyrics from a pop song, but felt experiences of the most profound type. My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine, softer than a sigh. My love is deeper than the deepest ocean, wider than the sky. My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above. And there is nothing in this world that can ever change my love. I know the ride to my friends house took about 25 minutes, although I had no real sense of time during this event. At some point during the ride or shortly after I got off the bus and starting walking towards her place I began to wonder if the event was going to stop and, if it didnt, what I would do, how could I visit with my friend. It wasnt a terrible worry, it just occurred to me that I just couldnt function normally with what was happening to me. This is where the plot thickens. I began the walk to my friends home. It had snowed and there were icicles hanging from the trees. In my love-enveloped state, I began to look at world and it was not as I had ever seen it before. Somehow, I had the feeling that Jesus was showing me how he saw the world, but that was a guess, he wasnt talking. Somehow, it wasnt substantial, but rather all made of the same beauti",,USA    Q.,"50,000",atheist,religious,Christian,Christian,,,dail,week,moder,moder,"25,000 49",post,I was w,,single,divor,Unc,moderately str,All pleasant,youth

582,ME ,1067,33,,F,"I prayed for probably 3 4 months, as I continued to read the Course and do the workbook. Suddenly, literally out of the blue, one day I had an encounter with my boss where I felt blamed for something that wasnt my fault. He said something to me, and I responded in a really defensive way. The moment I spoke my response to him, I felt the left side of my scalp tingle. Not just a tiny tingle, but the ENTIRE left side of my scalp really tingled like the way you might imagine it feels when a cats hair stands on end. During this encounter with my boss, I was fully aware something strange had happened on my scalp...but I was too wrapped up in the defensive discussion to really pay that much attention to it. Later on the same day, I had a negative thought about something else, and this very strong tingle thing happened again. Very shortly, I realized what seemed to be happening was that my prayer had been answered...I was being shown without question, which of my thoughts had a negative component to them by having this very strong tingle each and every time I had one! This amazed me, and still does to this day. For the next several months, I got used to this feeling and played around with it. It happens without fail, when I have any thought that violates Gods (or our own) nature. If my thought is really big, the tingle is really big and covers the entire left side of my head. If my thought is smaller, a passing thing, the tingle will still be there...only reduced to a tiny tingle on mostly the top of the left side of my head. As I worked with this feeling, I learned very quickly how to avoid the types of thoughts that would make the tingle happen. At this time, I rarely have the tingle...ie: I have trained my thought process to be much more loving. The tingle is still there very strongly if I slip up, however. I can also make the tingle happen on purpose, simply by deliberately thinking about a very negative or hateful emotion. I thought this was interesting in that it is something I can do at will, as well as it being there to warn me off bad thoughts when I havent been trying.

584,OBE,1341,66,,F,"I decided to take a Past-Life Workshop in the small, homey office of a hypnotist in Katonah, New York last year. Besides the hypnotist, another woman and myself were present. Before the session started, the pleasant hypnotist explained that she was going to hypnotize us. (I tried hypnosis one other time in my life but I couldnt be hypnotized. I thought, however, that I would try it again.) She said we would be going down a long flight of stairs. As we went down, we would be getting more and more tired. When we reached the bottom of the stairs, we would be hypnotized. Then she would direct us to go into a room where we would see who we were and where we were in our past life. It all sounded pretty okay, nothing scary. So, sitting in comfortable chairs, we closed our eyes and the leader directed us down a long flight of stairs. I remember the stairway was dark, but not frightening, and I was getting more and more tired. At the bottom of the stairs, she told us to open the door in front of us and go into the room but I saw a window opened and I flew out instead. I flew out into the dark universe. I wasnt in a spacecraft, it was just me flying. I remember just flying around in the darkness but not feeling afraid. I have a sensation that I was a young woman then, not my senior age at the time of this STE. I never actually heard anything. My experience was silent. I dont remember feeling cold or hot, but just right. I was wearing an ordinary set of clothes--pants and a top. I remember loving the experience of flying. I felt peaceful, serene and happy. I was flying alone, although I have a sense that my husband, Hank, was there from time to time. I remember seeing faraway stars and planets but I didnt land on anything. I was in heaven, in more ways than one. At some point I became aware that I was struggling to do something--waking up. I didnt want to leave the universe, I was enjoying flying so much, but I was awakening to my present human reality in the hypnotists office. When I awoke, the other woman was already awake. The hypnotist asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said I was having a hard time waking up. She thought I fell asleep but I told her I wasnt sleeping. The other woman talked about her experience and then I talked about my flying experience. The woman and hypnotist didnt say anything while I was describing my OBE. The session ended pretty much there. I remember feeling strange about being in this strange world on Earth. I wasnt sure I was okay enough to go out into the street and drive my car home, but I was. I can still feel myself flying in the dark universe, feeling peaceful and happy.

587,ME ,1270,29,,F,"In 1974 I was 29 years of age. (I am now 67 years of age.) I was feeling pretty despondent at that time, having spent four years trying to make a living as a visual fine artist in Manhattan but not succeeding. Not knowing how else to support myself, I enlisted in the Army. But as the day of my enlistment grew near, I was becoming increasingly anxious and fearful. I was a free spirit and knew I would hate losing my freedom and someone else telling me what to do. But if I didnt go, I didnt know how else to take care of myself. I did not want to go back to secretarial work, not after I fell in love with art. I was stuck in a tight spot.  Three days before the big day, I was sitting on my hotel bed. I had given up my apartment in Little Italy and took a room for 3 months in a midtown Manhattan hotel. I was just staring out into my room, not knowing which way to turn. It was daytime. With the suddenness of a light switch just turned on, a brilliant white, round glow with a more brilliant Christian cross embedded in the middle of the glow appeared before my eyes. The vision was suspended in mid air. The glow and cross were about ten inches tall and sat about eight feet in front of me, a little lower than my eye level. The light that emanated from the glow was contained. There werent any rays coming from it. The whole cross fit totally within the glow. The cross was a plain, elegant cross with no detail. The ends of the narrow vertical and horizontal bars were cut straight across. (This vision was entirely visual. I didnt feel, smell or hear anything.) Although the glow and cross were as intensely bright as a flame, I stared easily into it. I wasnt afraid by its presence or doubted what was before my eyes. I never said to myself, What is this? or Why is a Christian cross coming to me? I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish. Actually, my mind was blank, without any thoughts. But I was transfixed by this sight, spiritually locked into it. I was aware that the glow and cross were calming me down, making me feel peaceful and serene. I think I was staring at it for a short period of time, maybe 15 minutes.  I remember how the glow and cross came on but I dont remember how it went away. After staring at it, I think I put my head down on a pillow and went to sleep. But the strange thing is that when I awoke, not only wasnt the vision still there but I didnt even remember that I saw it. Actually, I didnt remember this event until 30 years later, when I was sitting in my car experiencing my epiphany, which I talked about in my February 23 submission to you. Looking back at that time, the glow and cross did not tell me if I should go into the Army or not. What this vision did was to calm me down, relax me and relieve me of a paralyzing anxiety which was keeping me from seeing clearly and making the right decision for myself. Relaxed and clear thinking, I made the easy decision to withdraw from my Army enlistment. I went to the Army base and explained how I felt. The female officer there agreed and gave me an honorable discharge.

I was shopping alone in my local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, buying stuff and yet another set of bed linens because I didnt have that particular shade of beige. I suddenly stopped walking and looked down at all the stuff in my cart and felt a longing. I thought to myself, Is this it? Is this all there is to life? That Peggy Lee song came into my head: Is That All There Is? I just stood there, in that store, staring at all my stuff in the cart, and feeling a strong yearning to find a deeper meaning to life. I wasnt thinking to find God yet. I just wanted to know a deeper meaning to life. I couldnt believe that life was just about cooking dinners, buying bed linens and sending people greeting cards. I didnt realize then that I wanted to find God. The funny and ironic part of this story is that God planted this second seed (the first seed had to do with Rose Kennedys face, which Ill submit soon) at the store called Bed, Bath and BEYOND. A girlfriend brought this irony to my attention, which I didnt get at the time of the STE. At the moment that my STE occurred, I told myself that I was going to find a deeper meaning in life.

605,DEE,1542,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

I saw the television and then I was just there, right in front of it. It was still on but I cant recall what was showing at the time this happened, I just know it was on and I could see it. I remember feeling this amazing sense of freedom and that I could go anywhere I wanted, as quickly as I wanted. I looked at the hotel room door and thought to myself, I want to go out there, see how far I can go like this. It was a very very pleasant and unbelievably exciting feeling, but I was also scared.  In that instant while I was looking at the door thinking about going further, reveling in this sense of freedom, speed and excitement, I suddenly I heard a voice (it wasnt a voice like we speak in the literal world, it was a voice that I could identify as male, I think, but instead of speaking out loud, it was like a knowledge in my head. Its hard to convey this correctly) saying If you want this to stop, you have to wake up now. I heard it and was still looking at the door. The voice/knowledge again said Sally, if you want this to stop you have to wake up NOW! with heavy heavy emphasis on the word NOW.

(I was somewhere between 3-5 years old) My father had gone to visit a neighbor two doors down (old Mr Safran) I was a timid child and for some reason I was utterly scared of this neighbor, even though there was no reason to be. He actually was a kindly old gentleman who even remembered the neighborhood children in his will but for whatever reason I was very frightened of him. When I awoke and realized it was (to me at least) late at night and my father was not yet home, I was terrified that Mr Safran had hurt him or killed him. (Again, no reason why I would think this) I was laying in my bed and I was terrified. I dont remember if I was crying, but if I was, it wasnt loud enough for my mother to hear. I was (and still am) the type of person that does not cry out for help. I dont know if I was praying for my father to be ok as I dont remember if I was old enough to have been taught about free-form prayers. Anyway, I felt a warm, comforting, loving presence that assured me everything would be OK. (And of course it was, as my father had never been in any danger whatsoever other than in my mind) It was like being wrapped up in a warm soft blanket of love and happiness. It was so long ago and I was so young that I dont remember anything beyond that but I have never forgotten it either.

629,OBE,1531,30,,F,"I must first start out by explaining that I have had OBEs my entire life, beginning when I was about 9 or 10 years old. It was at this age that I began watching tv programs about people being visited by their guardian angels, or other such spirits, who had saved their lives, or sent these people messages of some monumental significance.  I was very much affected by these programs and began praying to god, or to whoever was listening to me, for some sign of the \xe2\x80\x98other side,\xe2\x80\x99 because I knew deep inside that there was more to life and I wanted to experience it firsthand as these other people did. I prayed every day obsessively and even created my own Ouija board out of paper and a ring, thinking I could make some sort of connection. The ring did eventually move, to my astonishment, but it was just my own energy that I was becoming aware of. So I began to feel my own energy throughout my body, as I do to this day, although for some time I believed it was a spirit taking over my body because it felt so foreign at the time, and as a young child I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better.  Shortly after being aware of my own energy I began to feel my energy leave my body at night when I was falling asleep.  It was incredibly startling and disturbing, as it would jolt me awake, just as I was beginning to fall asleep. As I would awaken my energy would immediately slam back into my body. As a child I thought this was the devil taking my soul away, and I used to cry and pray to god at night. This happened all the time, and it was very frightening, and there was no one I could tell because I knew I would sound crazy. One night when I was crying and praying, I suddenly felt \xe2\x80\x93and had the image of- someone kissing my cheek. I felt the energy touch my face and sink into my skin- and then I felt an immense, overwhelming wave of intense love encompass my entire body, and I knew in my soul that I was loved and taken care of, that I was perfectly safe. I was in complete shock, and my tears turned to tears of joy- someone had responded to my prayers! I knew I was going to be ok! Somehow whatever was happening to me at night was not as horrible as I thought it was\xe2\x80\xa6and so I let it happen, knowing I was protected. I was so stunned by what happened-I had truly made a connection, the connection I had been yearning for. I knew there was more to this life, I knew there was nothing to fear, that someone or something was looking out for me. My fear of evil dissipated. I got used to feeling my energy leave my body at night, and it became a familiar sensation. Years later I would meet a friend in high school who would explain me that what I was experiencing was astral projection, and I would read books on the subject, as well as on many other metaphysical topics. As a teenager I would meditate and consciously expand my awareness, teaching myself to experience that profound love again and again, I would see auras, and have many other eye-opening spiritual experiences.  Throughout the years I have experienced OBEs in my dreams quite often, where I am flying around outside, in my house, out in space, all over the place. It is a fabulous feeling. I have not been able to consciously leave my body, though-only in dreams. As an adult I am very spiritual but I do not believe in any one religion or doctrine, nor in any god, heaven or hell, or in evil. I believe in my experiences, and in a profound and universal love that we are all a part of, not separate from, because of what I have felt and witnessed in my lifetime over and over again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 20 yrs old, and I was on lithium for 10 years when we come to the present time when this story unfolds, in July of 2013. There are many other events surrounding my experience I am to speak of, which are important to mention. At the time I most likely had lithium toxicity, as I was physically sick and severely confused, and my body was in convulsions for what seemed like weeks. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat very well on my own due to the spasms and it took me an immense amount of time to get dressed and perform normal tasks due to the uncontrollable spasms caused by lithium toxicity. I never knew what day it was it was or what had even happened the day before. I was in bad shape. At the same time I was also malnourished for reasons I can only speculate onmy boyfriend had recently broken up with me so I had fallen into a deep depression, I was hardly eating, forgetting to take my meds, and hardly sleeping. I most likely was suffering from a mental breakdown. I was 89 pounds, which was also caused by the fact that I was on adderall- I had already been underweight, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how in the world I had lost 10 pounds so quickly.

630,ME ,1366,34,,F,"I was sitting under a tree and began to think the tree was conscious. Shortly thereafter I felt I was being contacted by my deceased father who said he was worried about the fact that my mother still smoked. (He died of lung cancer in 1981). After a day another entity took my fathers place. He said his name was Thieliel and that he was a Greek scribe who had been captured by the Assyrians and forced into service. I got a flash of him falling to his death from a tower and some pages of strange script. He said that as a suicide he had chosen to spend some time in the afterlife as a guide to prevent the suicide of someone else.  After this encounter, for several days the world seemed to get darker and more threatening, like, physically. My husband wanted to put me in a mental hospital and I feared Id never see my children again. At the worst of it I said a common Catholic prayer--at that point, I was hearing terrible suffering and was aware of this inky blackness. As soon as I said the prayer, whoosh! right out the top of my head into the Light. The Light was 1) timeless, 2) all knowing, 3) perfect love. I was part of it, yet myself also. I saw in this state that time as we know it is an illusion and that love and knowledge cannot be separated.

639,OBE,1229,44,,M,"Almost immediately after taking the divine plant I began to fall out of my body. It was a wholly new sensation for me. After years of pursuing the actual out of body occurrence it was nothing as I had imagined it to be. There is noting that can compare one for the actual sensation. During numerous mediations I had always imagined myself rising above my body to look down and view myself. But this is not what actually happened. I actually fell into myself. I literally fell out of myself and by falling inside myself. And then instantly found myself floating above my body laying on the bed. The experience of being pulled out of the body was not an unpleasant sensation rather it was the first time to feel it and all firsts are usually associated with some fear. In this case it happened so fast and the train I was on had no exit routes, so I was on it for the duration. Once I was above my body the experience was quite pleasant. I was amazed at how I looked. I also notice the family cat was aware of my presence which I found quite interesting as it gazed upon my astral body. Just as I was becoming acquainted with my new surroundings I was yanked yet again in another direction at an astounding rate through a tunnel towards a light. Upon reaching the end of the tunnel I seemed to be deposited on the other side of a threshold. This place was completely and utterly spectacular. I was suddenly connected to everything was the feeling I remember most. I only needed to think of something and the associated response was with me. The communication was so much different here. I wasnt thinking in words but pictures associated with strong feelings and emotions. And I was like a newborn. I had very little experience in this new environment. It was very much a fish out of water experience. The thing that left the most lasting impression on me was this. I was able to look back on where I had just come from. The physical world. It was close. I could perceive it clearly as if it were a separate dimension but very close. I began to focus on the edges of it as it didnt seem to be wholly formed yet. The colors were so vibrant and alive.  So organic. The edges looked like caviar. And It came into me that I was perceiving the physical on a molecular level. I was so amazed. Then suddenly it came through me like a lightening bolt. These molecules perceived me. They were aware I was looking at them. Communication!! Images and information passed at an alarming rate. I was aware of the rythme and reason for everything coming into being. It filled me with a sense of joy I had never felt before. I laughed. I knew what life really was. These small bits of life....molecules...all formed based on collective thoughts. We all were creating everyday. We just didnt realize how powerful our thoughts we were. Then I was aware of a presence behind me. It was so brite and so large. My first thoughts were not of intrigue but of how small and dim I was. And just this tiny bit of hesitation flooded me with thoughts of....had I killed myself. Suddenly I was flooded with thoughts of fear. I wanted to know if I was alive. I yearned to feel my body again. So I prayed to feel my body again. And I was propelled in that direction. It was not an easy maneuver. It took some time to anchor myself in my body but it was accomplished. I had set up a timer on the side of the night stand. Total duration was 15 minutes. It had felt like an eternity. There was actually no sensation of time where I had gone. It did not exist.

641,ADC,1173,34,,F,"Sunday morning at a local antique car show with my family I was overcome by a message in my head from a grandmotherly voice. You can eat less, you will still be fed. You dont have to fear not being fed, it is a different time now. I knew pretty quickly that the message was for the intuitive. However, I did not want to pass on the message. As a psychiatrist I was keenly aware that such a message could be exceedingly destructive to a person with a history of an eating disorder. I resisted the STE...this only made the message louder and more difficult to ignore. It repeated not only in my head but in my body, insistent. I felt myself becoming rapidly ill. My body ached as though I had the flu. Within 30 minutes I had to leave my family at the antique care show and go home. At home I tried vainly to ignore the pounding message and sleep to no avail. Finally in desperation I said aloud okay, already, Ill tell her. I sent the intuitive an email explaining the situation and while I had extreme doubts about the social moire and the professional impropriety of my action, as soon as I sent the email I was flooded with relief. The flu-like symptoms and the message vanished. I crawled to bed and slept deeply for several hours until my family returned (as I have never done before.) It was several days before the intuitive finally contacted me and told me that she had prayed to her grandmother the friday before I met her asking desperately for help with her weight gain. The intuitive was perplexed that she normally receives insights for her clients, yet here was a straight-laced ivy league educated physician being contacted by her grandmother with literally the answer to her prayers. When I saw the same intuitive two years later for a brief ten minutes, she revealed that the message had quite literally changed her life. Specifically she had been able to return to her typical body weight easily and without dieting and maintained it for the intervening time. Secondly she had secured a new job and a book deal where my message to her was the climax of her autobiographical book!

652,ME ,1030,49,,F,"I pulled onto the Interstate and slid into the left lane. The car in front of me was a red convertible and as I pulled closer I realized that I knew by the vanity plates who the person was driving the car. The plates were and I knew that was the owner of the Hotel who we knew socially. Then a voice spoke to me and gave me instructions and reasons why all at the same time and in just a few seconds I had been told what I had to do to be safe. The voice explained that the car was about to go out of control and speed into the center median. Then the person driving it would over-correct and speed across the interstate in front of me just in time for me to T-bone the car and kill both of us. The voice told me to simply take my foot off the gas and coast...that would slow my car enough to avoid hitting the car and the semis behind me would not hit me. Just exactly as the instructions were completed I took my foot off the gas and the entire scene played out before me. The car started running off to the left into the median kicking grass up and speeding toward the steel barrier...at 1st I thought it would be sliced in 2 right down the middle, but then the driver began to swerve back into my lane. He cut across 2 lanes...and because I had already slowed down ...he missed me by inches...clipped the car behind me and to my right and slammed into the guard-rail on the other side of the interstate.

653,ADC,1363,25,,F,"I sat on the edge of the bed as Shawn tried to comfort me, my crying seemed to intensify with the downpour of the rain. I looked up at the ceiling in our bedroom asking God for a sign. I asked him as a Catholic, saying out loud: I have faith and I know they say he is in a better place, but I need MORE! I need PROOF that he is OKAY! And just as I shouted this at God a sudden loud bang and flash of white light filled the bedroom. Shawn and I physically jumped out of bed because the crash was so loud we thought the window was going to crash in on us. We looked at each other, puzzled. Was that for us? Because the timing was just as if God was answering my prayer. Just as that happened we began to calm down and the rain also subsided. I told Shawn that it felt like an answer from God and it was so strange. The next morning Shawn went out to our car that was parked on the street. He heard muffled music playing that grew louder as he got nearer. When he opened the car door the radio was blasting music very loud on my brothers favourite radio station. When Shawn tried to shut the radio off, it would not turn off, he had to pull the system out of its dock to make it turn off. The radio remained like that for years. The wires were fried because that night our building and our car was hit by lightening, the very lightening that crashed outside our window at the very moment I asked God for a sign / for proof that John was okay. That isnt the end of it. From then on it was like the floodgates had opened. I got all kinds of signs from John, all kinds of instances of after-death communication, including a full apparition, physical phenomenon, electronic phenomenon and I would like to share that all here. I could write my own book about all the signs John gave me and my family after his death. He loved us so much his love transcended death and the tragedy of his loss made it that much more important that he get through to us and let us know he was okay. And God made it possible for him to do that.

I remember almost everything going back to this experience. Thats what makes it stick out so much to me. My human consciousness takes me back to this day and there is literally nothing in my memories before it. There is not trauma, no injury, no conceivable explanation for that absence. With that, the STE starts with me floating in the universe. Im very calm and have absolutely no concerns or preconceived notions about where Im going. All there is was the sudden realization that I exist. As I float, I can see earth getting closer. I start to fall through the atmosphere, the clouds, etc. but the experience is not frightening at all. I see things start to form on the ground, like roadways and towns. I see what would be my small town, circle terrace, the top of a bunch of houses, etc. as I continue my downward movement. Just as I get ready to hit the roof of our house, my eyes open in my bedroom.

Terry\xe2\x80\x99s battle with cancer started in 2007-where it was diagnosed in the colon. He was successfully operated on in September that year and recovered, remaining healthy until March 2009, when a tumour was removed from his small intestine. He received chemotherapy at Tygerberg Hospital afterwards and seemed well. He continued to play his gigs-he said the music took his mind away from the pain. His last gig was just after New Year 2012 at the Shuntin\xe2\x80\x99 Shed in Bot River-but he was very weak by then.  The last six months of his life, he was cared for at home-with the help of Hospice. Terry slipped into a coma on Thursday 28th June-I spoke to him and told him it was alright to move on, that his daughters T&#232;gan and Tullia, and I, would be fine. I also asked him to send me a sign when he crossed over. He passed away in the early hours of Friday morning. He was smiling. I knew he had left us, and in the early winter morning, I looked out of the window up at the grey sky-completely overcast except for a very defined sliver of blue sky- in the perfect shape of an electric guitar. I was so grateful for that sign. Terry had asked a good friend of his to sell his beloved Fender Telecaster (which he bought in America) to help support his family-as he had been unable to work for months. I was told that the lady who bought it was called Tracy; and she had bought it for her partner, John, whom we had never met, as they live near Johannesburg. The morning of Terry\xe2\x80\x99s passing; I received a call from Tracy, enquiring how Terry was. I told her that he had passed away in the early hours of that morning. She gave me condolences and put John on the phone. This is what he told me: On the night in question, at about 11:45 p.m. my very faithful dog, Sasha, nudged me with her nose and would not stop...until I got out of bed. I was at my farm, not far from Hartebeespoort Dam at the time. Only to find Sasha sitting next to the Fender case... I made a cup of coffee, called my dog to the kitchen and she would not budge. I know that it sounds weird, but, I had to play the telecaster... my dog left the room as soon as I plugged the guitar into the amp... played a few bars of John Lee Hooker and went to bed. As you know I phoned you the next morning to offer my condolences... how I knew that?... your Terry was with me, of that I am sure... I feel that he has been back, too often I find myself compelled to play the tele. Bear in mind, I have seven other guitars, all very good... but the tele keeps calling...??? The guitar is well and safe... I play the smoke out of it and love the mood it leaves me with... I am sure you understand what I mean by that. In any case, I have no opinion on the life here after, but, Terry Dean was with me and wanted to hear me play, to see if I was up to scratch, I think?

662,DEE,1399,51,,M,"I could hear people speaking who were around me, was well aware of my surroundings--I did not expect this visitation to happen. I had said a little prayer (just in case) asking for forgiveness for those I had directly or indirectly hurt, and waited to die--so I thought. I wondered what it would feel like; i.e., would the lights just go out, would it be painful, or what. I could not tell the sex of my visitor, it appeared to clothed in a lovely robe-like material, was very human in appearance, had a lovely smile, appeared gentle and loving and I could see through it. What surprised me most is that it spoke to me without words. The thoughts just jumped into my mind. It knew what I wanted to know just as I had the thought develop in my mind, and I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d Looking back on the experience, that thought makes me smile every time I think about it--it really happened that way. The message was that of love, that it did not matter whether I lived or died--I would be cared for. Finally, the overriding message was, LOVE WAS ALL THAT MATTERED and I did not need to worry. The visitor stayed with me for some time (several minutes) and when I turned to look away, out the cabin window, I could see the lights of a city below. When I turned back, my visitor was gone. In a way, this proved how real the visitation was. It was NO dream. After the plane landed, I was met by an ambulance and taken to Daniel Freeman Hospital. Thinking that I had a Mexican GI upset I was taken to a ward treating GI problems, a nurse noticed that my blood pressure dropped to nearly zero, I was then rushed to a CC unit and placed under the care of a cardiologist, Dr. Ciralo (sp?). There I was diagnosed with severe cardiac dilatation and heart failure, it wasnt until later that a pheochromocytoma was discovered. I was severely hypertensive and apparently this was the cause of my heart failure. When my hypertensive condition was brought under control, my heart returned to normal. This was all documented by ultrasonography and angiography. The pheochromocytoma was removed from my abdomen 1 month later at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. I think back on the experience and still worry about the unknown, but listening to the audio tape of your book has helped restore my faith in the reality of my experience. Thank you!! My experience is with me nearly every day. My visitor never returned, but I do think we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet again someday.

Ive always been calm in a crises so I took a few deep breaths to try and relax, hoping that would release my jaw but it didnt work. I remember saying to myself Ill just go back to sleep and itll be all right in the morning. I fell asleep and saw I was in a tunnel which was lit up. I saw ghostly figures at the end of the tunnel beckoning me forward. Just as I got to the end of the tunnel, it began to recede and I was being drawn back to my bed. This upset me and I fought to get to the light but I couldnt. As I left, one of the ghostly figures told me that if I left I couldnt come back, that this was my only chance to go there. When I woke up, the whole experience felt like a dream, including not being able to move my jaw. I soon forgot about it. Years later when I was in my late thirties, I experienced double vision and went for an MRI. The consultant said I was fine, no problems, but that Id had a mini stroke when I was a teenager. It was then I remembered my experience. I told the consultant what had happened to me at the age of 15, (leaving out the spiritual bit) and he said that it definitely sounded like a mini stroke.

That is the best way I could describe it. Experience was hyper real Was able to confirm once with a sister-in-law, that while my body was not present, I was with her and accurately observing her.

683,NDE,1117,30,,M,"I was walking along a road. It was not paved, but a gravel path, very nicely maintained with beautiful flowers along the sides. The road started in a valley and went up a hill towards a very beautiful mansion or palace with a gate in front of it. It was far off in the distance from where I began to walk, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say how far exactly. On either side of the road, the land sloped away sharply, like going off a cliff, so if one fell off the road, one would land in a deep, dark pit. From the pit one could hear sounds of agony, wailing, and lamenting from human beings who were down there. Some tried to claw their way up and grab at me on the road, but I knew they could not actually reach me. I was a little afraid at first, as I knew this to be the pit of hell. The road was not narrow, however, so there was no danger of me falling off the road. I began walking towards the gate, all the while the lost souls wailing until I got near to the gate. Close to the gate, they were no longer around. The mansion was very beautiful. The whole environment was other-worldly, somehow glittering and radiant. I knew I was on another plane, no longer on Earth. I could hear the gentle music of stringed instruments in the background, very soothing and lovely. Eventually I started nearing the gate of the mansion or palace. The mansion was actually quite far from the gate, but one could see radiant beings behind the gate going about their daily activities. Some were carrying baskets with flowers and all were going about their daily routine. There was complete unity and love there, unlike the way people on Earth behave. It was serene and peaceful, just a wonderful place, and I really wanted so much to go inside. There were four winged angels guarding the gate on the outside, two on each side, and as I approached, they moved together and crossed their arms, blocking my entry. They were radiant beings, clearly not human. They were so very kind, but were not going to let me in, although they did not say anything to that effect. There was so much joy and peace there, I tried to get by them, when a group of beings from inside approached the gate to talk to me. An elderly \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d (not a human being) with white hair spoke to me. Although he was right in front of me, his voice sounded like he was very, very far away. It was almost like I was hearing an echo of something said in the distance. He said I would be there at a point in time, but not yet, that my mission was incomplete and that I still had a lot more to accomplish. He was very kind and spoke gently to me, absolutely convincing me that I could not get in. Until this moment, I had really not thought about anything relating to my earthly life, although I knew who I was. I was dressed as I was the day of the accident. When he told me that I could not enter, only then did I start to try to think about what had really happened to me and what was going on. I thought it odd that I was the only person around and there were no dogs or other animals. As I was considering all this, I left that place. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I actually regained consciousness at that precise moment, but I suspect I did. I did not recognize any people whom I knew previously who had died. I also did not know any of the people in the pit.

689,DEE,1234,24,,M,"Introduction While I read through \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven\xe2\x80\x9d I was struck by the similarity of several distinct items that were present within a spiritual experience that occurred to me. The items that Dr. Eben Alexander presented in \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven that were similar if not identical to what I experienced are as follows: 1.) Peoples clothes were natural to the environment. 2.) The experiences were perceived to be magnitudes more real than normal life. 3.) The \xe2\x80\x9cglorious chant\xe2\x80\x9d was everywhere and came from many places. 4.) A exhilarating sense of unity with all that exists. 5.) Dr. Eben Alexanders description of communication as, \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts that entered me directly\xe2\x80\x9d is similar to the direct communication with the Word of God that came upon me. The Word communicated as if through every subatomic particle field--not through words but through the Word of God. Although the religious experience written here is in dream format, the information transferred and situations experienced were of a supra consciousness nature. The religious experience developed as an independent psychological process over a twenty year period--from adolescence to adulthood. The religious experience happened to me at age 24 on September 03, 1979. I am 57 years old. Since I was 24 years old I have had no extraordinary psychological experiences. Personal experiences with direct spiritual development of consciousness are eternal and transcend both living experiences and after death experiences. Heaven is not strictly an after death state and something, perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic mind,\xe2\x80\x9d interacts with the human brain and shares some obscure affinity with each human mind. In a sense \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d is omnipresent; heaven is all around us but we typically fail to see it. Both living and after death experiences attest to this fact. This experience is of the living variety.  The Trances From age 4 through 21 I had experienced approximately 10 trances that would take me to what seemed like another dimension. My first recollection, of two symbols that appeared in one form or another throughout the trances and in the religious experience, was from a time as a kid with high fever. I saw two sparkling nuns that were walking along an infinite seashore. Children were playing beneath a sun umbrella and fragile autumn leaves blew across the sand. I perceived an infinitely dense black line coming from the sky to crush the leaves, the sun umbrella and the children. I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe line. the line\xe2\x80\x9d as my mother put cold water and rubbing alcohol on my forehead to reduce the fever. The trances stopped occurring during fever (associated with illness) around 10 years old. But I would try to stay awake by watching T.V. late into the night because I knew the trance would take place if I fell asleep and that scared me. Usually when the trance started Id get up out of bed and sit in a chair. The experience then caused the world to fade out. The walls of the room would disappear and a dark space with two huge dense masses of sparkling energy would transfer their energy back and forth through a sparkling, connecting line along which the energy flowed. I had no recognition of my presence. When the one mass would become infinitesimal to the point of disappearing, the other would become dense and heavy. Then I would become frightened. But, eventually, the energy would transfer out of the dense and heavy sparkling mass along the line and back into the one that almost disappeared. The last few times, around 20 years old, when I experienced the trances, the episodes were witnessed without fear. Id get up out of bed, sit on a couch and simply watch the show. Afterwords, I thought that was really strange but it didnt make any sense so I didnt think much of it. When I was 24 years old, at a time when my mind was biologically mature, I had a profound religious experience that seemed to be the end result of the trances. It was in the form of a dream that I could understand. Although this experience was in dream-like symbolism. I experienced it far greater than waking life experiences. Perception and emotion while in it had been enhanced. I often referred to an increase of reality to a magnitude of 10 when recounting the experience. Carl Jung stated that what acts is actual and this experience was actually the most intense experience in my life. Like a dream that you try to recall, while it fades away with the more time that passes between waking and the writing of it, much of the details escaped my memory at the time of writing it. I was in tears and quite overwhelmed upon waking but some parts of the dream that I remember and wrote are still remembered along with the emotional intensity as evidenced in my consistent effort",,US Citize,2001 2,spiritual,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,dail,week,very strong,avera,"0 24,999",some,Machini,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

Now at 12:30 at night I thought the effects of the mushrooms were wearing off. After staring at a spiral tapestry for a moment, I spun into a deep state of transcendence. I have had experience with psychedelics before in the past but never experienced anything close to what happened next. I sat in a circular cozy sofa and closed my eyes and my consciousness entered a dimension where it felt as if I had tapped into an eternal network of knowledge. Bursts of ideas regarding life and its wonders popped into my consciousness like bubbles, each identifying value which could not be explained by words very easily. An understanding of love was undeniable as it clearly is the adhesive force binding all of life. I understood that life requires a balance of the extremes and that death is nothing to fear but simply the critical point where our spirits transcend the physical realm. I could not see anything worth noting but the knowledge brought to my attention introduced me to the most profound spiritual presence I could ever ask to experience.

711,ADC,1187,43,,F,"One night after Cloy\xe2\x80\x99s funeral I was lying in my bed in the middle of the night unable to sleep. I was experiencing incredible deep agonizing emotional pain. I had left a church that I knew wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true and I had been ostracized by family and friends for doing so. I was divorced and felt so alone in the world as a single mother. I was curled up in a ball, hugging my knees closely to my chest. I always shook when I cried. It was as if something was trying to shake loose inside of me to finally be free, but it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make its way out, and so I was strangling, squirming for spiritual air. I cried and trembled. Suddenly something other-wordly occurred. I saw Cloy at the end of the hallway. She came towards me into my room. I recognized her because of her outer form. I say outer form because she was translucent, yet color filled, if that makes any sense. I could see through her, yet I could recognize completely that it was her. As she came towards me I said in exclamation, Cloy!\xe2\x80\x9d  It is difficult to describe what happened after that because words cannot describe what occurred next. There simply are no words on this planet for it. All that I can say is that Cloy somehow filled me with what she feels wherever she now is. Suddenly I felt as if someone had placed a needle about two to three inches long in each and every pore over my entire body, starting at the top of my head and ending with the bottom of my toes. The needles had something in them that was the essence of pure unadulterated ecstasy. It was a joy that I have never felt in this earthly existence, and I am certain that it does not exist at the earthly level of vibrational being. The needles tingled full of warm bubbly unconditional love. It was Christmas and Valentines and Halloween all in one. It was chocolate kisses and truffles and the sweet nectar of watercress fresh out of the mountain spring. It was children\xe2\x80\x99s laughter and hugs and unity squared. I was in a state of complete euphoria and exultation that I have never before or since experienced. I was involuntarily smiling from ear to ear. I could feel myself smiling, but it was not me doing it. Seconds before I had been in utter agony. Now, I was so overcome with happiness, that the smile on my face felt permanent. I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not smiling I am being smiled!\xe2\x80\x9d  I lay in the midst of this pleasure and rapture as the needles continued to tingle and pour warm, pure, syrupy, liquid affection into my veins. The veins carried it swiftly to my major organs and I breathed tender compassion. My blood became a river of sweet adulation. I then realized that if there were a drug that could reproduce that feeling \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d be on it twenty-four-seven. As a social worker dealing with methamphetamine users, I had wondered why in the world these people would take drugs and lose everything for it. Instantaneously I knew the answer. I mean, if it feels anything like what I felt that night, I can understand why someone would sell their soul for it. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this feeling was ethereal from another realm. I could only guess that Cloy was aware of my secret agony and she was giving me the ecstatic feeling that is constantly present wherever she is to assuage my pain. The message of the feeling was one of (and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to say this in words because it was conveyed to me beyond words \xe2\x80\x93 it was communicated soul to soul, mind to mind \xe2\x80\x93 words just cheapen it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how else to describe it except with words) \xe2\x80\x9cJane, you are loved unconditionally and you are OK just the way you are. The apostles aren\xe2\x80\x99t right. The church isn\xe2\x80\x99t right. There is no right. There is no duality. Love, love, love. You are love and you are loved. There is only love.\xe2\x80\x9d   I closed my eyes and luxuriated in the heavenly tingling. Eventually it subsided. The needles slowly pulled out of my body, starting at the top of my head and finally leaving altogether through the ends of my toes. I am thankful to Cloy for showing me such support and joy.

712,ADC,1385,37,,F,"    After closing the front door shut, I looked up to see this very sad look on my Daughters face, she was crying. I didnt think for one minute she was dead. I told her to come down off the stairs and she just looked at me blankly, pleadingly. That look will haunt me all my life. It was then I noticed my dressing gown belt, which was made of a silk like material around her neck. Reflecting back on this, I realise now that the stitches had broken so this had stretched giving the illusion, Tracey was standing on the stairs, leaning against the wall.    Thinking she was unconscious but alive, I realised by locking the door, I had locked out any chance of help from neighbours. I asked my little girl to go in the kitchen and get a chair. Put it near the bench and stand on it. On the top of the cabinets above, there are some scissors, bring them to me?    Bless her, she done everything asked of her while I held Tracey from her own weight. My little boy cried and cried and cried in a panic and was too young to understand the urgency what was going on around him other than he knew there was something very wrong.     I cut my Daughter free, called 999 then started Life saving techniques. I did have the support of the emergency service by phone. Although the ambulance service is a five minute journey to my home, I found out later there was a mix-up as the houses were within the first six months of building and the postcode had not gone on the register.     Thirty five minutes later, with a two year old still screaming and a five year old who thought there was blood on her sisters neck when actually was the marks like rubber bands make if you leave them a while around your wrist.     This was so traumatic for everyone who knew her. I also has two other children to consider. One aged thirteen who my now dead Daughter was very close to and my eldest Daughter, who was married and living in army quarters of Germany    Without my other children, I would not be here today. They gave me a reason to go on. They had suffered enough. My Daughter was pronounced dead when the ambulance eventually arrived.

My sight of these things was shortly focused on something else, as I saw a tall, black, shadowy figure standing right in front of me. I was frozen with fear as obviously this sort of thing doesnt happen everyday for me.. So I just stood there looking at it. It seemed malevolent. I just had this feeling that it knew I was scared of it, and that was an achieved goal for the figure or something, and it slowly started to walk (move, float) towards me.

The entire thing was made out of bone that had been polished. It was made from human bone! But for some reason this wasnt creepy at all. It was kind of like, the bones of the maryters or something? It was a way to honor them? Anyway, we were going in to check it out. I had a group of kids to watch, 4 or 5 of them. My daughter wasnt there as I remember, I think she had gone ahead. There were some boys who were slower and lagging from the general group so I stayed back with them to encourage them to keep going not to get so far behind.

Like a very old one from a language that is not spoken anymore. But she spoke to me in English. She told me to pump some water from the well into this teeny tiny cup. So I did that, the cup was even smaller than a thimble. I wasnt sure what I supposed to do with it? Dip my fingers into it and make the sign of the cross like Holy Water? Or drink it? I didnt want to offend or do that wrong thing! She told me to drink it! But it understood immediately that it was to be just a small amount, I was not to drink the entire thing.

724,DEE,1369,50,,F,"At the age of 50, I had an experience that transformed my life. I had been working with a tool in a secluded area of my home. I left the room for a few minutes, but when I returned, the tool had \xe2\x80\x9cvanished\xe2\x80\x9d and was never seen again. After exhausting every possible explanation for the disappearance, I felt my world falling apart. For the next few days, all I could do was to walk round and round the house in the hope that somehow the tool would mysteriously reappear. The experience was like being thrown into an alien universe, where all the laws of the only universe I had ever known had ceased to exist \xe2\x80\x93 it was like living in a world without gravity. When I eventually regained my composure, I began thinking of ways to solve the mystery. I had heard that the CIA uses psychics, so I made an appointment with one of these people in my area. Although he could not see what had happened to the tool, the psychic indicated that a being on the other side wanted to communicate with me. He described her as wearing a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s uniform and giving her first name as Edith. He could not understand her surname, but he thought it started with a C or a K. When I suggested \xe2\x80\x9cEdith Cavell\xe2\x80\x9d, he told me that was correct. (He had obviously never heard of the remarkable English nurse). Through the psychic, Edith accurately described a pendant I owned. She said I should hold it completely still and then ask her a question. If the answer was \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99, the pendant would move one way; if the answer was \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99, it would move another way. Being of a sceptical disposition, I did not believe that something I owned could ever move of its own accord. But on arriving home, I did what Edith had suggested and to my absolute astonishment, the pendant moved as she had indicated \xe2\x80\x93 either vertically or horizontally. After a new months of fruitful yes/no communication, I asked Edith a question one day, but instead of its usual movements, the pendant swung around in a circle. Eventually I discovered that a circle indicated the need to rephrase the question. Not long after that, Edith changed her mode of communication to one where she caused my hand to move in different directions. Then one day I asked a question, but there was no response. It turned out that Edith was handing me over to someone else. The only way I could ascertain the name of this being was to go through the alphabet. I found it almost impossible to believe that the name of the new guide I was being given was Aristotle. I was in such a state of anxiety that I contacted a renowned psychic without giving him any information about myself. At the consultation he told me he was being given a vision of philosophers in Ancient Greece. This gave me reassurance that I was not losing my mind. Aristotle told me that I should apply to do a PhD in philosophy, and that I should do a lot of background reading. To this day I have never been to a philosophy lecture \xe2\x80\x93 let alone studied in the field. When I eventually rang the Professor I had chosen, he \xe2\x80\x9cforgot\xe2\x80\x9d to ask me about the previous work I had done in philosophy.  After being accepted by the University, I began a difficult journey, but I had a wonderful supervisor who carried me through. At one point Aristotle said I would need to use a concept by the very early philosopher, Anaximander. Of course I had never heard of this thinker, but I used his concept to unite the various ideas I was presenting. Later on, Aristotle handed me over to the modern French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. By this time I had become used to the miraculous, which was just as well, because I found Jacques\xe2\x80\x99 writing difficult to grasp. In the end, thanks to all the help I was given from the other side, the two examiners I had described my dissertation as \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d. (It is titled \xe2\x80\x9cHeidegger and the mystery of being\xe2\x80\x9d and is on the web). Among other things it addresses the question of mysticism, and I am now interested in relating mystical experiences to the idea of the divine. From what I have read in Dr. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s book, and from my own experience, it seems difficult to conceive of God as an all-powerful being who sends people to hell if they don\xe2\x80\x99t repent. The evidence seems to be overwhelming that the whole of the universe is love.

I knew immediately that something unusual was happening. I was wearing a long white robe and I had sandals on my feet. It was very warm. I remember thinking wow why is it so warm in a dream this is way too real. Just then I bit down and felt a grain of sand between teeth. I stopped and said to myself wait, this is important because it is real. I walked between 2 buildings made of what looked like adobe to me and I kept walking until I entered a courtyard that was of good size. There were clusters of men standing around talking with one another and they were dressed somewhat like me except they had more colorful gear on. I remember thinking that I was in Bibical days by the way they looked. In the center of the yard were a group of boys playing some kind of ball. They were chasing a ball (that was really a bunch of rags tied together). They were kicking the ball back and forth and seemed intent on playing a game. As I looked around, over to my right was a young boy about 8 to 10 years old. He had that look of dejection about him. He was leaning against the wall with his left shoulder. He was looking down and was moving the sand around with his foot. My mother instinct kicked in and I felt compassion for the boy because I knew he had not been chosen to play. I moved over behind him and that is when I reached out and touched his shoulder. He turned and looked straight into my eyes. The air literally left me and I dropped to my knees. You see, it didnt matter that he was a boy I knew him. I knew him and I began to cry. It was the Savior. Without his lips moving, transferring language to me directly to my head (but more putting it into English falls so short; it was like a thought that came to me and then blew up inside my head) but I HEARD his voice and I knew it. How do I know it? I dont know but in that moment I remember saying Oh, I know that voice! I knew that I missed him so much. I knew that I had been bought and paid for (atonement)if I chose to allow it (free agency and all). I loved him. I sensed the largness of the universe and how there was no end . . . but wait . . . he spoke Cindy, I never fit in. From that statement I understood that he didnt have to show me the cross . . . he really means he was a weird human among humans. That is all that I heard . . . everything else is as real . . . it just was that odd hearing/listening thing. Here is the significant exchange to me . . . I felt the love.

If was like I could have reached out and picked it up . . . it had substance. And, it hurt. The love was so much that it hurt and I was humbled by what I felt. It was over. I sat straight up in my bed and looked at the clock. It was 2 a.m. For the next few weeks, the feeling didnt leave me. Sometimes I would just look at a group of students on the BSU campus and want to burst into tears because I knew how much he loved them. Then, like all things, the memory started to fade. A few months later, I got down on my knees and begged for the gift of always remembering that feeling and the event. I dont think about it every day. I am 61 now. But, I can recall it all.

736,NDE,1388,54,,M,"Bam!  That had to be a plane, I thought to myself. Nothing else could possibly be moving that fast. The force of the impact had snapped the drivers seat off and I felt the car being catapulted forward. That in itself was alarming.  I had been traveling north on I-75 just north of Atlanta, GA and had just been readying to exit the North Marietta Loop traveling at about 60 mph when the impact from behind had occurred. Just a couple minutes prior I had seen some jets taking off from Dobbins Air Base. It wasnt a plane that hit me though. It was an uninsured 19 yr old driving an unregistered vehicle. Witness reports put his speed at over a 100 mph as he wove in and out of traffic coming up I-75.  The impact caused the back end of my car to jerk out to the right. The wheels on my Toyata Corolla seemed to grab the road surface. I could feel the car begin to turn over. I knew how fast I was going. I knew the car would be turning over and over in a wild tumble. It was without a doubt one of those entire life in a flash moments. There wasnt a lot of time for any lengthy reminiscing though.  Just two thoughts went through my mind. The first was a pondering why Divine Spirit had chosen this time for me. Wow, I really thought Ive learned a lot in this life. Im just at the point in life where I might be able to offer others something worthwhile. Why now?  The second thought was expressed in a spirit of surrendering, God, I really only have one request. Id really like to take all that Ive learned with me to my next life. Please dont require me to learn everything all over again. Reincarnation is something that Im completely familiar and comfortable with.  The car began to flip over. I could hear the metal shearing and the glass shattering all around me. I felt the tumbling effect. I felt like I was inside a long tunnel like whirlpool. In the center of that incredibly fast spinning darkness I saw a bright white light, warm like the sun, very quiet and very serene.  Total silence.  I opened my eyes. Cool, I thought. I made it through this and Im not even hurt! No pain at all!  Then I tried to move. Not so much as a finger responded. I was lying face down, head in the back seat, my feet somewhere up around the area of the steering wheel. A thumb was pressing hard against my nose and lip. I could see that it appeared, by its relative positioning, to be the thumb from my left hand, but it was my right thumb. I could also see that my right arm bent in an awkward position under my throat. God, Im glad Im paralyzed because that would really hurt if I could feel it, I said to myself.  Totally paralyzed, I thought to myself. Quadriplegic. I will be a burden on everyone for the rest of my life.  I then concluded that because I was unable to feel any pain, that I probably had serious internal injuries as well. I would die here, but at least I would die without pain. I thanked Divine Spirit for that blessing.  I could literally feel myself, as Spirit, sinking slowly down and out of my body. It was a deeply sickening feeling. Then I heart a tapping sound. Are you all right? a womans trembling voice asked.  Im paralyzed. Call the police, call the ambulance. I said. At least I could talk, I thought to myself.  That started a flurry of activity. Over the next half hour, I heard sirens, people yelling and screaming, and the unmistakable sound of a helicopter. All the while I laid face down, head in the back seat, not moving. All the doors were jammed. The parameds were frantically trying to reach me and couldnt. They kept saying, Stay with us now, stay with us. They ended up cutting off the entire roof of the car and very carefully they lifted me out. I was placed on a stretcher, moved to level ground, and was immediately given an IV.  At least 5 or 6 medical personal surrounded me. The one directly above my face said to me, Mr., youre going to be all right. Then a womans voice said, Mr., have you made arrangements for organ transplants?  Yeah, I said. Its on my drivers license. I could see the guy directly above me stare down the lady who said it.  Then another voice spoke up. Mr, do you have a living will?  No, I said. I looked up at the guy above me and said, Im in it pretty deep, huh?  He smiled down at me and said Id be fine. Yeah, right, I thought to myself.  They strapped me in the lifeflight helicopter. Off I went to the Atlanta Medical Center Spinal Trauma Unit, the best such facility for hundreds of miles in all directions. Upon arriving I was placed in the operating room recovery room. Apparently there was more room there for all the medical personnel to gather round me.  After being taken for CAT Scans and an MRI I was returned to the recovery room. After the initial blur of activity, another seriously injured person was brought into the room. She was obviously near death. The doctors",,    Q.

It was odd as it seemed as though it was daytime not nighttime. The next commented I made to myself was I could see the top of an apartment building nearby and the air conditioning units on the rooftop. Shortly after that point I felt or sensed something above me. A feeling of warm love and a golden light radiating from above but all around caught my attention. As it did, I slowly ascended towards this wonderful place above me but after a few moment I felt the presence of two beings. I dont seem to recall actually seeing anyone I just felt/knew they were there. There seemed to be something humorous or playful about them I want to say angels but it seems awkward to do so.....

I agreed after a bit and started to head down and when I felt there attention drift I turned back and headed towards the light. They quickly appeared or I felt them nearby and again they said I had to return. This time I, in the way of a child said, but its so wonderful I dont want too.

742,NDE,1052,42,,F,"As I was holding my son I began praying (to a God that I hoped existed although I certainly was not sure actually did...too much scientist in me). As I held him and prayed I became keenly aware of this dark presence following quickly behind my son and me. This awareness was not in real time but still, an intense awareness of this strong force. I began having chills and intestinal disturbances and felt true terror. As I felt this force nearing both of us and about to encircle us. I was very aware that this force was actually the dark angel of death. My prayer changed from please God, allow my son to live to God, if you have to take him then he is your child not mine. And I am aware that I am your child as well and you will have to help me. At that precise moment I felt a shift in my sons breathing. In the upper left corner of the room I became aware of a brilliant and luminescent light. This light slowly grew and filled the upper quadrant of the darkened room. I honestly thought that I was having a stress induced migraine and was having an aura. However, when I turned my head the aura did not follow with my movements. The light remained in that left upper corner of the room. The brightness of it grew and grew and enlarged to where it filled the room. I tried to look at the light but it was too bright. The light was the most brilliant and beautiful light that I have even seen. I had never (and still have never) seen anything like it. It was more than light...like it had consistancy. And then this incredible awareness occurred and my thought was oh my God, its God. And in that moment I becamse aware that God was/is more real than anything else that I had ever seen or known. My perception of God changed in that instance from my being a skeptic to the assurance that God is a definite and known entity. It was as real as anything that I have ever seen. I felt bathed in this glow and felt warmed....held and loved. Im not sure how long this lasted but slowly the light rescended but the awareness did not. The feeling that I had was the peace that surpasses all understanding. I knew that my son was going to be fine. My chills disappeared and I felt no more worry or anxiety. The doctors continued to check on my son and finally an hour after the light appeared they came in and said we think that hes turned the corner. I felt like they sure got the news on a delayed schedule. For a long time I felt that I was having some stress response to my sons health crisis but the knowing has never receded. Ive ever since referred to this as my near death experience by proxy. My son improved and was released from the hospital several days later. That event still is vivid and real in my mind like it happened yesterday. The awareness and belief from that experience has continued on to this day.

750,NDE,1276,45,,M,"My first memories was a sense of unnatural sounds like the building itself was breathing or living somehow. I saw through the walls to a room that I knew was on another dimension or in a spiritual plane. In this room, men sat and leaned against the walls while they waited. I knew somehow that they were waiting to escort the dead to another place. I knew that I was close to death in this moment and that was the reason I could see them. I was not afraid. I just knew it.  My next memory was of a village setting that looked medieval or European. The streets were cobble stone and the buildings were stone as well. People walked in groups down the road. I think a better description would be that they wondered aimlessly. They looked straight ahead, slightly downward and seemed to be without hope. I had an overwhelming feeling of gloom in this place and I felt as though they were being punished or detained in some way.  The thing that was MOST striking about these visions was there absolute vividness. It was as though I was seeing them with the most high definition TV ever seen. I could not explain how powerful this sense of visual clarity was. It was as though it were more real than real life. Even though these people seemed as though they were not supposed to look at me, occasionally one would lock eyes with me for just a moment. They had such despair in their eyes that it saddened me to make eye contact.  Later I was in this same place in a large arena, though that is not really the right word. It was a place in a large building that had a circular path that came in one door and passed in front of what seemed to be stadium type seating.  I had a feeling that people were paraded through this place in the lines I had seen them walking in on the streets to possibly be judged or reviewed in some way. Again, the architecture was like nothing I have seen here in the states. It seemed very old and mostly made from stone.  My next and final memory was my defining moment where I was like a speck dust floating in a space that felt like a large room. I was exactly like those particles of dust that you see floating randomly in the open space of a room as the sunlight passes through a window. I was free, floating on an invisible river of air through this space, around a tree or plant, feeling sheer joy and amazement. I had no identity in these moments. I had no memory of anything personal or earthly. I only knew that I was truly at peace. I was one with the universe, completely accepted, and loved. I felt such joy in those brief moments that it makes my heart race even now as I recall it. As I passed through this space, I saw a very obvious ray of what I thought was sunshine coming downward from the right from no obvious window or light source. I didnt question anything, but I remember a sense of really hoping that I would drift through this light. As I did enter the light, I felt happiness like I have never known. I felt as though anything I had known before this moment was infantile and insignificant. I knew this was the presence of God, though I did not see a face. I dont even know that I had the ability to look at the source of the light. I just basked in its glory.  I saw flashes or arcs of light zipping above me. They looked like just that really, but I felt like they were something bigger than me, something more than I could even try to understand. Later, I remembered seeing a phenomenon called flying rods that I have seen myself in videos that I have where these things that are not visible to the naked eye show up on high speed video and they appear to swim through the sky with multiple wings on a straight translucent body.  I wonder if these could be what I saw in this place. As far as I know this phenomenon is not explained scientifically yet, but you can find hundreds or thousands of video accounts on youtube by searching for flying rods. I may be nothing, but then again...  I had a number of very substantial things that became known to me in this place. For one, the reason that everyone describes these visions as being so vivid is that we are not looking at them with our failing human eyes. We are seeing them in a supernatural state of being where our tired old eyeballs could not even begin to compare. Also, I became acutely aware that I am a being inside of a being. I felt that I am a spirit aside from the conscious brain thought, which I always thought was ME. Suddenly, I had all of these memories of things like driving on long trips when I am complete zoned out in deep thought, yet somehow my body is driving the car, slowing and speeding up in traffic, using turn signals, and yet I arrive 30 miles later not remembering the drive. It occurred to me that there is a watcher within us that is the true us who is ready to take the wheel at any moment if we zone out, so to s",,US Citize,"50,000",religious,spiritual,Unaffilia,Unaffilia,,,weekly,week,very strong,very st,"0 24,999",Some,Compute,,divor,single,Yes,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

758,NDE,1065,42,,M,"From an account I wrote for my family and friends in 2001. The big event happened one night while we were visiting the Oregon Coast. We had not planned to spend the night- but did at the last minute. The only available motel was an older place with horrible soft, old mattresses. From what I can figure out- halfway through the night, while kind of curled up against the wall, I slipped off the mattress, and got wedged between the wall and the mattress. I then had an apnea attack- and the inability to move, or breath, sent me into some state of cardiac failure. This is all conjecture, and only supported by the mild abnormality in my EKG over the past years since. Whether I coded or not, is really not at the heart of the issue or my experience. There are tons of debates regarding what really happens when you die by both medical and theological theorists worldwide. I can only relate what I experienced.  I admit that even as I write, it sounds like science fiction- but I can assure you that it happened- and I believe it to be real in every sense.  Without trying to be overly dramatic, the next events were what I have found to be in subsequent studies, a classic Near Death Experience. I did not see myself in bed (many report floating over their bodies), as the room was too dark- but I was blasted through an amazing tunnel (plasma? lights? not sure) of brightness that brought me ever closer to an unbelievable bright light. In what seemed like minutes (regular time does not seem to apply)- I arrived in a place that was so overwhelmingly bright and swimming with fluid colors of the entire spectrum, that I did not at first realize that I was without my physical body. While I could see- or at least had a sense of the vision that I was seeing- I could not see my hands. It was about this time that my experience was significantly different than others I have read about.  I realized what was happening, and I was not happy about it. Almost immediately, I started screaming, in a voice that I could hear in my head- but could not physically perceive- No f***ing way! (except there are no asterisks in heaven) NO! I am not finished yet! I still have young children- I have not seen my life through yet! NO Damn It! I continued with a stream of verbal abuse of anyone that was listening\xe2\x80\xa6in very profane language, until I heard another voice say, OK\xe2\x80\xa6relax\xe2\x80\xa6its not your time.  I knew at that moment, two very clear truths to be real. First, I was not going to die yet (or stay dead if I was). Second, there was a God and an afterlife beyond our life on earth. Then things got strange, interesting and terrifying.  Unlike other NDE experiences I have read about, I did not see anyone, or feel the presence of Jesus, or Buddha, or Allah. Nor did I see a physical presence of any of my relatives that had passed before me- although I had a feeling that they were there with me.  What I did see was a much brighter place, perhaps 30-50- feet away (I had no real clear understanding of depth or ratio) that seemed almost to pull at my heart (if I had a heart) to come closer. I was awash with a complete feeling of peace, calm and contentment whenever I looked in the direction of this portal. And yet I knew, that moving into the portal would certainly mean that I would not be able to return to my life on earth.  Without speaking, and yet speaking and understanding what was spoken to me, a conversation ensued that changed my life.  You are troubled\xe2\x80\xa6 the voice said. Your need to know the truth about your life, is holding you back from living your life to the fullest.I agreed without speaking.  You must understand the gift to be able to enjoy and treasure the gift that you have been given, the voice said. At this time, while the voice was neither clearly male or female (I realize that does not make a lot of sense), I knew that the communication was coming from all that is\xe2\x80\xa6all that was\xe2\x80\xa6all that ever shall be. The voice was that of what I understood to be God. And yet- even then- while thinking this, it was evident that the entity knew what I was thinking- and chastised me for doubting, or trying to figure out its very existence.  In order to understand that which you feel you must understand to be happy, you must first know what you need to change in your life on earth, the voice said.  In an instant, I was seeing my life in review- first all of the wonderful feelings that had brought joy into my life. I saw all of the incredible events of my life when love, the most powerful positive force in existence, was most present in my life. Childhood memories, my first real loves, the births of my children, the first time I knew I loved my wife more than I loved myself- anything and everything associated with love in my life- flying past my eyes and filling my ",,US Citize,"251,00",spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,moder,littl,"100,000+",some,Owner o,,marri,marri,Yes,moderately str,Pleasant & distressing,adult

It was a way to honor them? Anyway, we were going in to check it out. I had a group of kids to watch, 4 or 5 of them. My daughter wasnt there as I remember, I think she had gone ahead. There were some boys who were slower and lagging from the general group so I stayed back with them to encourage them to keep going not to get so far behind.

766,ME ,1067,33,,F,"I prayed for probably 3 4 months, as I continued to read the Course and do the workbook. Suddenly, literally out of the blue, one day I had an encounter with my boss where I felt blamed for something that wasnt my fault. He said something to me, and I responded in a really defensive way. The moment I spoke my response to him, I felt the left side of my scalp tingle. Not just a tiny tingle, but the ENTIRE left side of my scalp really tingled like the way you might imagine it feels when a cats hair stands on end. During this encounter with my boss, I was fully aware something strange had happened on my scalp...but I was too wrapped up in the defensive discussion to really pay that much attention to it. Later on the same day, I had a negative thought about something else, and this very strong tingle thing happened again. Very shortly, I realized what seemed to be happening was that my prayer had been answered...I was being shown without question, which of my thoughts had a negative component to them by having this very strong tingle each and every time I had one! This amazed me, and still does to this day. For the next several months, I got used to this feeling and played around with it. It happens without fail, when I have any thought that violates Gods (or our own) nature. If my thought is really big, the tingle is really big and covers the entire left side of my head. If my thought is smaller, a passing thing, the tingle will still be there...only reduced to a tiny tingle on mostly the top of the left side of my head. As I worked with this feeling, I learned very quickly how to avoid the types of thoughts that would make the tingle happen. At this time, I rarely have the tingle...ie: I have trained my thought process to be much more loving. The tingle is still there very strongly if I slip up, however. I can also make the tingle happen on purpose, simply by deliberately thinking about a very negative or hateful emotion. I thought this was interesting in that it is something I can do at will, as well as it being there to warn me off bad thoughts when I havent been trying.

I was going through emotional trauma because my parents were divorcing and my beloved father had suddenly, without warning to me, and permanently left our home, leaving me to fend for myself with my withdrawn, unaffectionate mother and my older sister who hated me. One day I was leaving our 6th floor apartment to visit a friendly neighbor. I opened the front door but I stood on the threshold and couldnt go any further. I looked down the long dark hallway but I couldnt take a step off the threshold and out onto the hallway floor.

I tried to turn around to go back into my house but I just stood there unable to move. I couldnt move in any direction. My mind wanted to move but I couldnt get my body to move. Then a strange thing happened. I saw an ethereal mist surround me in the shape of a cocoon and it began to wrap itself around me, starting at my feet, going up and stopping at my neck. My whole body, including my arms, was wrapped in this mummy-like cocoon. It made me feel safe, protected and warm. It calmed me down. Then I got an idea how to break out of the paralysis. I suddenly put out my arms and began to twirl off the threshold. I twirled and twirled all the way down the long hallway. I remember my twirling became a habit because I was twirling in my home, in the hallways and in the streets. I thought I was dancing. I think that people thought I was dancing.

776,ME ,1301,40,,M,"March 1991 had a Thursday fall on the 21st and 28th, and the next Thursday was April 4th. The significance of these dates to me is that one of them was likely the day that I was invested with a powerful message in which the reign of God was revealed to me in no uncertain terms, within the fabric of a pointed admonition. The message came when I was awake. It came in the form of receiving the feelings of other people, to be exact, feeling the feelings of the hospital patients of the Lyons, NJ, VA Hospital. I had recently tried to volunteer at the Lyons VA, but had become discouraged after an incident in which I had been trapped outside in freezing weather with a nursing home patient who could not make it up the stairs to enter the VA clinic I was taking him to. The nursing home was a separate building from the main ring comprising the hospital, and buses shuttled the patients between them. When this patient could not get up the stairs I sat him on a bench outside, went inside, and called security because it was 22 degrees and blowing. The security guys tried very hard to find fault with my actions. I resented the accusations, and frankly, was not thrilled with my job, which essentially duplicated the \xe2\x80\x9cred shirts\xe2\x80\x9d job as a helper for the nurses. I wanted more patient interaction. I decided to stop volunteering. I was in alone that morning in my hot tub not far from the hospital, in Basking Ridge, NJ. It was probably a Thursday because I generally took Thursday off work, even back then. I remember having a sudden fleeting thought that it was a shame how the VA volunteer attempt had turned out. It was sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cno good deed goes unpunished\xe2\x80\x9d thought. I felt what people describe as the \xe2\x80\x9cdoor open\xe2\x80\x9d in my consciousness, in my head. I can only describe it as an odd sensation. And then poured forth into my consciousness were the feelings of all the patients in the hospital, at that time probably 800 souls. The feelings were anger, helplessness, desperation, fear, and loneliness, and probably more, but these were feelings showing the needs of the people who had them. They hit me like a ton of bricks. I was stunned. I have never felt anything so intensely before or since. The feelings lasted only a few seconds, I think, not long at any rate, and were gone. This experience, this message, which had many aspects, was beautiful, was efficient, and was obviously purposeful. I knew instantly what the feelings were, whose, and who had sent them. They were meant to tell me I had made a mistake. They were meant to tell me to go back and try again. They were meant to tell me that God loves those patients, and that He loves me. It was adapted to and respectful of my situation, which is that I am in an interfaith marriage with a non-Christian. It showed me that God lives outside of time and space as we know it, which explains a lot. In short, it was the greatest gift I have received from God, with the possible exception of my wife, whom I suspect was steered to me by Him. I was quickly able to deduce that if God loves me, no one particularly special or virtuous, He certainly must love everyone in the same way, just as we had been told from childhood. I was always a believer in God, but as a young man had found God inconvenient for a while, and I had come back to the church 15 years earlier in another episode which I suspected was a spiritual intervention. But, while I could swear with 100% certainty that I believe it was a spiritual experience, it was one you can think of as \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d, a compulsion to seek out a priest immediately, while this was a \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d one. There was no mistaking this message from God. I practically stopped breathing. It was a 20,000 volt shock, like grabbing a spark plug wire, and just as unmistakable. So what was the outcome? Well, I found another way to volunteer at the VA, one where I was more in contact with the patients. First I read to a group of nursing home patients for about 10 years, and then I began to do bedside visits. In a couple of years I began to find this very difficult as my patients began to die, and I fled by moving to another town and becoming a literacy volunteer. The hot tub message is the defining moment of my life, and I was not told not to talk about it. But speaking has its costs as well, one of which is that it seems to have so little effect on people, while it has revealed the Lord to me. Still, it did not make me into a saint, and I found I still struggle with the same failings that I had before. But it is a great blessing, surpassed only by those experiences in which people have felt the great unconditional love of the Lord for each of us.

The path turns to switchback up a bare-dirt shoulder smoothed by winter\xe2\x80\x99s snow melting. At the crest, suddenly the view opens up expansive, to all horizons like the Swiss Alps. The whole Cascade range is carved at my feet: vivid green chasms, peaks painted white, no hint of civilization.  A pure sky of small cotton ball clouds streams from the horizon directly toward me, and I have to brace against this wild steady wind that spurs an endless herd of white stallions. Suddenly close and larger when leaping over this ridge, they tuck their legs at the last minute, skirting these wind-braced gnarled trees and my hand stretching up.  I used to tag along on your weekend hikes to places like this, your sanctuary. Me scurrying behind with little legs, trying to keep up with your tall, long easy strides.

I Wish You Were Here\xe2\x80\xa6.     I lay my head onto the sand.   The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it.   Im counting ufos.   I signal them with my lighter   and in this moment i am happy,  I had a rare chance to visit your grave, passing through on my motorcycle. So many years ago this dot on a map, a hiccup in a straight flat line, was the stifling world I escaped at eighteen. Now its just a hot, dusty-small, freeway town. Surreally, everyone is a stranger. An earlier self\xe2\x80\x99s memories are just a story, gratefully too distant for emotions. The gravel road turns behind juvenile hall where I waited for my new foster mom after you died. The tiny catholic cemetery holds a few hundred family histories, a white, white statue, larger than life, divides two centuries. Mary, weeping, holds tortured Jesus in her lap. I know, neither one of us is Catholic, but mom was. I park the motorcycle. One key with one fob, a little silver disc etched with three lines one side, three broken lines the other; I-Ching symbols for Heaven and Earth.  Two unkempt, neglected yellow rose bushes grown mis-matched almost cover your name, so I trim a few branches. Ive never believed a spirit is buried, you are not here. But this is the last place on earth our paths intersected, so where else to go? No dates on the stone, I am sorry. I was too young to remember when the funeral home asked. But I am ok now.  You would be so proud of your beautiful granddaughters. The best of all of us, together.  You would like my husband, my soulmate. With him I\xe2\x80\x99ve surfed tropical waters with whales and turtles, biked Canadian passes, found love. Your spirit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to carry the burden of our grief anymore. I am no longer in a place of confused tears. Not even here. This sunny day.  Birds practice their songs above me, sitting back on an old tree; leaves quietly stirring sunbeams. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the Hispanic graves, decorated like a party. A family has recently left, spending a few happy hours with a beloved. Shiny balloons gently sway in the breeze.  Its a relief to share the peace we both so desperately needed so long ago. Then thoughts of the remaining day start to impede. A grocery list of errands, people to visit, hours on a clock, all interrupt me to leave. From the cool mowed grass I pick up my smartphone filled with facebook and emails, then in my hand the phone plays Wish You Were Here.  Dad. Are you telling me youre ok now too? I put the phone down to be here, a little while longer.  Love is greater than space and time.

786,DEE,1251,40,,F,"My experience happened approximately 2 weeks after Sept 11, 2001. I had been meditating in bed and felt myself drift off. My now ex-husband was sleeping next to me. Suddenly there was a bright light surrounding me. I could not see anything but gold light. The brightness of the light began to dim so I could open my eyes. When I did, there was a beautiful Michael Angelo angel with me. It was very large, probably a good 7 feet with huge wings and a face that was so serene. It was the most beautiful face Ive seen. And filled with such kindness. I felt like I was in a huge warm wave because the vibration surrounding me was like being rocked by a gentle tide while lying in a boat. It was beyond comforting. The angle knew that I was very upset about the direction of humanity after 911 and told me, not with spoken words, but with telepathic words, that everything would be ok and that I needed to keep reminding people what brought us to that point. I needed to speak of bring love and not focus on hate or enemies. The angel told me it knew I felt very alone but to remember that I was not and that I should keep putting out the message of love. It touched my face and then it slowly vanished. I was sitting up in my bed and tears were streaming down my face and I cant even describe how I felt because there are no words...but I was the most comforted I had ever been in my life and felt like I belonged to God and the universe.

Years later when I was in my late thirties, I experienced double vision and went for an MRI. The consultant said I was fine, no problems, but that Id had a mini stroke when I was a teenager. It was then I remembered my experience. I told the consultant what had happened to me at the age of 15, (leaving out the spiritual bit) and he said that it definitely sounded like a mini stroke.

799,ME ,1451,24,,M,"Detail may take a bit more space than there is here, but I will attempt. Briefly, very tired, I fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed like the beginning of a dream sequence, I found myself on the second floor of a mansion in town that I was quite personally familiar with. From a spot in the hall, I noticed flashing lights coming from the hallway of the west wing. Irritated and needing to investigate I went in their direction. Where the halls joined at a right angle, still more lights and, of all people, my great aunt staring into the lights at the end of the hall. Very agitated at this occurence, not knowing if it was fire, or some other upset that required my attention, I began a trot in its direction. At that point I recall (kind of like Santas reindeer!) a lifting of my feet and legs and up I went. In very short order all went dark, all fell away (my body, place, circumstances)and the essential me of me was involved in an ascent...until coming to said portal mentioned earlier in which all I can recall were cloudlike formations over a cauldronlike (and that word is not to have any negative connotation) basis...with what was bubbling up from the cauldron mixing in with the clouds above it and this was perfection and creation in action. My KNOWING at that time was that I was in everything, everything was in me, and that everything was in a perfect balance. The other notion I had was that the energy was so powerful that if it were withdrawn everything would collapse, but that that would not happen...furthermore, the word calibrated came to mind. As in, everything was perfectly calibrated to hold only its allotment of that energy, and that one-zillionth more of it and a body would burst into bits. At the portals edge, even though I had no body or even much in the way of caring about what had happened to it, I do recall my hands grabbing the portals edge and I kind of docked there and went no further...only witnessed the roiling of the generator of all that is, was and would be (as described before.) At about the point of docking and peering in, I was conscious, alert, awake and aware, and said to myself: OMG, Im dying! and then something to the effect of I didnt want to do that. (That would be the distressing part and I almost clicked another choice for 42.) As soon as I said that the experience of coming down began, the up there having been short-circuited by my ambivalence or fear...even as I quick-changed my mind and said, No, NO! (leave me up here for a while longer.) The coming down was not so memorable in and of itself. What there is to know is that I did then and still do sleep on my back...and I felt as if my feet were the first to gain life back and then the descent of the rest back down as if my astral back to stomach and like that. As my arms were folded across my chest, they were the last to come to and I recall being conscious of that happening. Upon full re-entry I was quite astonished at the whole thing and lept out of bed as if every cell was on fire and said Holy S**t, Theres nothing I cant do! Later on I went at myself over that notion-thinking that it was a bit egocentric, but I digress. I further recall that everything in the room had a bit of a glow to it, and so probably did I. I also remember being fascinated at a pencil in my room. Its interiority struck me as magnificent...and to think that none of it (me, my body, material circumstances) had mattered or even existed just moments before was quite startling.

802,ADC,1185,45,,F,"To continue, after I went back to sleep, I had a dream which I consider an after death communication as it was very powerful to me anyway.

In the dream it was just my loved ones brother and me. In the dream, I asked him, Wheres Bob? The brother said, What you want is overwhelming for him. We just looked at each other for a moment after that. In the dream, I felt a little confused. But I reached to hug my loved ones brother and said, Hugging you is like hugging Bob. Then we hugged and after that he dissapeared and the dream was over.  After I woke up, I remembered the dream very clearly. But, just like I was confused in the dream, I was confused when I first woke up. I thought to myself, What does he mean that what I want is overwhelming for Bob? Then I remembered that I had asked for the sign in the form of a particular song. I was stunned.  It was like my loved one sent his brother to tell me he couldnt give me that particular sign because it was too overwhelming. And to this day, though I have received many signs from my loved one, I never have heard this song playing anywhere! I guess it really is overwhelming!

805,ME ,1301,40,,M,"March 1991 had a Thursday fall on the 21st and 28th, and the next Thursday was April 4th. The significance of these dates to me is that one of them was likely the day that I was invested with a powerful message in which the reign of God was revealed to me in no uncertain terms, within the fabric of a pointed admonition. The message came when I was awake. It came in the form of receiving the feelings of other people, to be exact, feeling the feelings of the hospital patients of the Lyons, NJ, VA Hospital. I had recently tried to volunteer at the Lyons VA, but had become discouraged after an incident in which I had been trapped outside in freezing weather with a nursing home patient who could not make it up the stairs to enter the VA clinic I was taking him to. The nursing home was a separate building from the main ring comprising the hospital, and buses shuttled the patients between them. When this patient could not get up the stairs I sat him on a bench outside, went inside, and called security because it was 22 degrees and blowing. The security guys tried very hard to find fault with my actions. I resented the accusations, and frankly, was not thrilled with my job, which essentially duplicated the \xe2\x80\x9cred shirts\xe2\x80\x9d job as a helper for the nurses. I wanted more patient interaction. I decided to stop volunteering. I was in alone that morning in my hot tub not far from the hospital, in Basking Ridge, NJ. It was probably a Thursday because I generally took Thursday off work, even back then. I remember having a sudden fleeting thought that it was a shame how the VA volunteer attempt had turned out. It was sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cno good deed goes unpunished\xe2\x80\x9d thought. I felt what people describe as the \xe2\x80\x9cdoor open\xe2\x80\x9d in my consciousness, in my head. I can only describe it as an odd sensation. And then poured forth into my consciousness were the feelings of all the patients in the hospital, at that time probably 800 souls. The feelings were anger, helplessness, desperation, fear, and loneliness, and probably more, but these were feelings showing the needs of the people who had them. They hit me like a ton of bricks. I was stunned. I have never felt anything so intensely before or since. The feelings lasted only a few seconds, I think, not long at any rate, and were gone. This experience, this message, which had many aspects, was beautiful, was efficient, and was obviously purposeful. I knew instantly what the feelings were, whose, and who had sent them. They were meant to tell me I had made a mistake. They were meant to tell me to go back and try again. They were meant to tell me that God loves those patients, and that He loves me. It was adapted to and respectful of my situation, which is that I am in an interfaith marriage with a non-Christian. It showed me that God lives outside of time and space as we know it, which explains a lot. In short, it was the greatest gift I have received from God, with the possible exception of my wife, whom I suspect was steered to me by Him. I was quickly able to deduce that if God loves me, no one particularly special or virtuous, He certainly must love everyone in the same way, just as we had been told from childhood. I was always a believer in God, but as a young man had found God inconvenient for a while, and I had come back to the church 15 years earlier in another episode which I suspected was a spiritual intervention. But, while I could swear with 100% certainty that I believe it was a spiritual experience, it was one you can think of as \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d, a compulsion to seek out a priest immediately, while this was a \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d one. There was no mistaking this message from God. I practically stopped breathing. It was a 20,000 volt shock, like grabbing a spark plug wire, and just as unmistakable. So what was the outcome? Well, I found another way to volunteer at the VA, one where I was more in contact with the patients. First I read to a group of nursing home patients for about 10 years, and then I began to do bedside visits. In a couple of years I began to find this very difficult as my patients began to die, and I fled by moving to another town and becoming a literacy volunteer. The hot tub message is the defining moment of my life, and I was not told not to talk about it. But speaking has its costs as well, one of which is that it seems to have so little effect on people, while it has revealed the Lord to me. Still, it did not make me into a saint, and I found I still struggle with the same failings that I had before. But it is a great blessing, surpassed only by those experiences in which people have felt the great unconditional love of the Lord for each of us.

809,DEE,1202,29,,F,"During the waiting period, I decided to speak to the Mother aspect of the Goddess. I was going to be 30 in about 5 months and was wondering about my lifes direction. When it came time for me, I was escorted down the lit path to the lower circle by an attendant; they helped people up and down the path for safety reasons. He asked me which aspect I had chosen and I told him. We walked over to where that Priestess was working. She had someone there and I was told to wait. She would tell me to come over to her when she was ready. She raised her hand and waved me over. I knelt at her feet. I felt an amazing amount of energy around me, it was actually quite warm. I was wearing a cloak but had to remove it. I didnt look at her face. A voice spoke and asked me what I wished to know. Her voice was clear, calm, and so beautiful. I asked for clarity in the coming years. If there was anything I needed to know or was missing. I could feel her smile. I had my eyes closed. The next thing I felt was her hand on my forehead. An amazing amount of energy surged through me and I felt like I had been drenched in love energy. I began to cry. I never felt so accepted, understood, and knew that no matter what I did or choices I made, I was loved and would always be her daughter. I wept. Such unconditional love completely overwhelmed me. Once we finished, the attendant came to help me up and I continued to cry all the way back up the path. He held me and we walked to the upper fire where a chair was waiting. He sat me down and got me some apple juice to drink. He told me to wait there until I could walk back to my camp unaided. Once I got back to camp, I kept crying for several hours.

Leaving an OBE felt like my body fit like a glove that was too tight. Was no emotional physical trauma going on at the time. Have not had these experiences since then. Of note, I have always been a lucid dreamer am aware I am dreaming while I am asleep and can consciously influence what is going on in dreams I enjoy flying, changing locations with a thought and walking through walls. Also of note have always felt unconditionally loved its just kind of who I am. Feels like something I carry with me no matter the circumstances.

811,ME ,1311,61,,F,"In September 2006, Hank showed me a story and picture in our local New York newspaper, The Journal News, of the current Pope Benedict making a personal, nonofficial, visit to see the Veil of Veronica in Italy.

The Popes visit took place on September 1, 2006, the 500th Anniversary of the cloth being in this monastery. I was immediately drawn to this story.

814,ME ,1301,40,,M,"March 1991 had a Thursday fall on the 21st and 28th, and the next Thursday was April 4th. The significance of these dates to me is that one of them was likely the day that I was invested with a powerful message in which the reign of God was revealed to me in no uncertain terms, within the fabric of a pointed admonition. The message came when I was awake. It came in the form of receiving the feelings of other people, to be exact, feeling the feelings of the hospital patients of the Lyons, NJ, VA Hospital. I had recently tried to volunteer at the Lyons VA, but had become discouraged after an incident in which I had been trapped outside in freezing weather with a nursing home patient who could not make it up the stairs to enter the VA clinic I was taking him to. The nursing home was a separate building from the main ring comprising the hospital, and buses shuttled the patients between them. When this patient could not get up the stairs I sat him on a bench outside, went inside, and called security because it was 22 degrees and blowing. The security guys tried very hard to find fault with my actions. I resented the accusations, and frankly, was not thrilled with my job, which essentially duplicated the \xe2\x80\x9cred shirts\xe2\x80\x9d job as a helper for the nurses. I wanted more patient interaction. I decided to stop volunteering. I was in alone that morning in my hot tub not far from the hospital, in Basking Ridge, NJ. It was probably a Thursday because I generally took Thursday off work, even back then. I remember having a sudden fleeting thought that it was a shame how the VA volunteer attempt had turned out. It was sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cno good deed goes unpunished\xe2\x80\x9d thought. I felt what people describe as the \xe2\x80\x9cdoor open\xe2\x80\x9d in my consciousness, in my head. I can only describe it as an odd sensation. And then poured forth into my consciousness were the feelings of all the patients in the hospital, at that time probably 800 souls. The feelings were anger, helplessness, desperation, fear, and loneliness, and probably more, but these were feelings showing the needs of the people who had them. They hit me like a ton of bricks. I was stunned. I have never felt anything so intensely before or since. The feelings lasted only a few seconds, I think, not long at any rate, and were gone. This experience, this message, which had many aspects, was beautiful, was efficient, and was obviously purposeful. I knew instantly what the feelings were, whose, and who had sent them. They were meant to tell me I had made a mistake. They were meant to tell me to go back and try again. They were meant to tell me that God loves those patients, and that He loves me. It was adapted to and respectful of my situation, which is that I am in an interfaith marriage with a non-Christian. It showed me that God lives outside of time and space as we know it, which explains a lot. In short, it was the greatest gift I have received from God, with the possible exception of my wife, whom I suspect was steered to me by Him. I was quickly able to deduce that if God loves me, no one particularly special or virtuous, He certainly must love everyone in the same way, just as we had been told from childhood. I was always a believer in God, but as a young man had found God inconvenient for a while, and I had come back to the church 15 years earlier in another episode which I suspected was a spiritual intervention. But, while I could swear with 100% certainty that I believe it was a spiritual experience, it was one you can think of as \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d, a compulsion to seek out a priest immediately, while this was a \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d one. There was no mistaking this message from God. I practically stopped breathing. It was a 20,000 volt shock, like grabbing a spark plug wire, and just as unmistakable. So what was the outcome? Well, I found another way to volunteer at the VA, one where I was more in contact with the patients. First I read to a group of nursing home patients for about 10 years, and then I began to do bedside visits. In a couple of years I began to find this very difficult as my patients began to die, and I fled by moving to another town and becoming a literacy volunteer. The hot tub message is the defining moment of my life, and I was not told not to talk about it. But speaking has its costs as well, one of which is that it seems to have so little effect on people, while it has revealed the Lord to me. Still, it did not make me into a saint, and I found I still struggle with the same failings that I had before. But it is a great blessing, surpassed only by those experiences in which people have felt the great unconditional love of the Lord for each of us.

819,NDA,1386,17,,F,"One night, I had a dream. I remember being outside of my grandfather house. Outside of the house was my grandfather. He approached me, and we were happy to see each other. I knew it had been a while since I saw him. And, I also knew that she was currently sick and afraid of him leaving me [to the afterlife]. My grandfather took my hand, and we walked into his house. The view inside the house, during the dream, was identical to his real house. What I found unusual was that all the lights were out except the one straight ahead- his room.  As we proceeded to walk towards his room, he was telling me that things were going to be fine. That, at first, things were going to feel like they are spinning out of control. As if I was standing with my arms out, spinning in circles, losing my balance- THAT type of loss of control. Although I found comfort in his words, I didnt know what he actually meant, until after his death.  When we approached the bedroom door, I could not believe my eyes. In front of me, was a hospital bed and my grandfather was in it! My grandfather was in his bed, facing my direction; he was asleep. Behind him, sitting, was his 2nd wife, his daughter, Lucy, and his son, Danny. To my left [and my grandfathers], sitting on a chair, was my mother. All of them were looking straight at my grandfather. I could not believe that I was in the presence of two grandfathers- and the same one!!  Seeing my grandfather in the hospital bed created a magnetic pull. I could not remove my eyes from him. I had never seen him in such a state. He was always alert, active, and immediately greeting me. This was the first time that I ever saw him so disconnected from everyone else, especially in their presence.  Seeing that there was an empty chair right next to his bed, I immediately sat on it. I felt I was trying to be close to him as I possibly could. This was the man I had loved all my life. He was my father, my comfort, and my strength. I admired this man profusely. And, knowing that I had denied seeing him for so many months, he needed to know I was finally there.  I apologized to him for not being there for when he needed me the most. I told him I was scared of losing him and I was scared that he would pass away once he already saw me. (He had seen every family member, but me. Due to how our relationship was, my withdrawal had shocked everyone. I thought you loved your grandfather, why arent you seeing him? You know that he is dying. Go see him.) Once I finished venting to my grandfather, asking him for forgiveness, his eyes opened. He looked at me. I returned the look. And he closed them again. Right then I knew that I was right. He WAS waiting for me. He wasnt leaving yet because we hadnt said goodbye. And I was the last person that he needed to see. But, I knew that I wasnt ready to let him go. Feeling overwhelmed, I reached out to him. I went for his hand and I grabbed it. It was my first touch with him in months. And once I held his hand, I heard his last breath. I was then informed he died. Everyone around was crying, including myself. With the pain of a broken heart, and having everything feel so real, I immediately woke up from my dream. I woke up sweating and bursting into tears. I could not stop crying. I had felt as if my grandfather had truly passed away.  My mother, who was sleeping next to me at the time (she didnt want to be alone during this moment in her life- being a daddys girl) woke up with fright. She didnt know what happened to me. I relived the dream by telling her every single detail. She reached out to a relative who informed her that my grandfather was still alive. - Exactly one week later, still fearful of my dream, and still avoiding seeing my dying grandfather, my mom informed me that she had just seen my grandfather. She informed me that now it was just a matter of hours or minutes. Without thinking, I immediately got ready. It was probably 10:00-11:00 at night. On my way over there, those fears werent present. But once I walked up to my grandfathers door- all my fears came flooding back. I did not know what to expect. Was my dream just a dream? Or, would it become a reality?? As my mother and I walked in through the door. My heart slumped to the bottom of my stomach. Just like my dream- the house was dark except for the back room- my grandfathers room. I began to experience anxiety. I was praying my steps towards the room would be nothing like my dream. I had so much hope in those few seconds which felt like an hour. When I walked into the bedroom, there he was: my grandfather laying on a bed, facing my direction. Behind him, my 2nd wife, my aunt Lucy, and my uncle Danny. My mother took a seat to my left. And I, I was offered the empty seat next to him. The seat from my dreams!  I had so many thoughts come up.

821,ADC,1153,44,,F,"My best friend passed into Spirit on May 15, 2004 at the age of 45, after a 10 year battle with HER-2 Breast Cancer. We had spent 40 years weaving the fabric of our lives together in a dance that was just magical. Ours is a long story of love and friendship. It is hard to relay in a few words the significance of this miracle,but I will try.  Two years ago Karen started having massive headaches and was feeling weird. We were headed off to a healing weekend in New York State and having a grand time. It was just the two of us tooling around in the car and laughing and enjoying each others company. At one point, she became very serious and told me she thought her chemotherapy may be causing these symptoms. She was struggling as to whether or not to go off the chemo and just let God do His work. I told her this was a huge decision and one not to be taken lightly. I am a big believer in asking God to give us a sign when we need an answer to an important or not so important question. Because this was a VERY important question, I told her she needed to ask for a sign that would be unquestionable! Something so unusual that it could only be from God. I then said, How about if we see a green donkey? Then you can go off chemotherapy. She giggled and said, That sounds great. The rest of the weekend we searched for a green donkey. We found yellow pigs, purple cows, red dogs and even a green horse.How we tried to rationalize that a horse is almost a donkey. But we knew it had to be a Green Donkey. We even spent the next afternoon in Woodstock, NY going through every store but never found a green donkey. A week later the headaches continued and she went for an MRI. Her father also passed away from Alzheimers this same week. On the morning of his funeral, she received a phone call from her oncologist telling her the cancer had spread to her brain. She went through the whole day, a huge funeral, and never told a soul except her husband what she had found out that morning. She had courage beyond human strength. She made it through brain surgery and massive radiation and lived two more years. She passed on May 15, 2004 surrounded by her whole family. What follows is what I said at her memorial service (which 700 people attended). Notice the part about the green donkey toward the end. I have had the pleasure of knowing Karen for over 40 years and calling her one of my best and dearest friends. But I know I am just one of countless best friends that Karen had...there was something about her that just made you want to be close to her and know her better. To Karens family...she was a mom, a wife, a sister, a daughter, and a cousin, but for the vast majority of us here today, she was our friend. A friend of the truest sense and one that was there for each of us no matter what was going on in her life. Remarkable, selfless, trustworthy, sincere, kind, compassionate, spiritual, and beautiful are words that can only begin to describe Karen. Besides being a friend,Karen was a teacher. She taught me more about strength and courage than I ever wanted to know. When my son deployed to Afghanistan last Oct, she came to me one day like an angel sent from God. She held me, cried with me and instilled in me The Power of Now. This gave me strength that I did not know I had. If I can take one tenth of her strength and live the rest of my life, then I will be happy. I will miss her human presence more than I can even imagine at this time... her spirit while she was on this Earth was immeasurable. What I look forward to from this day on is how she will guide, love, and watch over each of us in her new found strength in SPIRIT. And so I say to you my dear Karen, Godspeed to you on this new journey you have undertaken. I know Daddy was holding your green donkey and that now you know all the Divine Order that is so hard for us to understand here on Earth. I giggle at the thought of our next life together and I ask you Sister Karen to hold down the abbey until I get there. When I returned home from her service that evening, there was a message on my answering machine from my son, who was in Afghanistan, serving in the US Army. He had never, ever called on a weeknight since he had deployed, until that night. This in and of itself spoke volumes to me. I was sad I had missed his call, but I knew he was OK and surely sending me some love from afar, even though he did not know of Karens death yet. Karen had given me extreme comfort and support while she was alive in regards to his deployment and no matter what was going on in her life, she always asked how my son was doing. That same night, the phone rang again around 2:30 AM and it was my son. What a joy to hear his voice! We spoke for about 20 minutes and during the conversation he mentioned that his best buddy and teammate had put new pictures up on a website ",,Citizen,1 2000,spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,very strong,moder,"0 24,999",colle,At the,,single,single,No,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult
822,ME ,1029,49,,F,"I pulled onto the Interstate and slid into the left lane. The car in front of me was a red convertible and as I pulled closer I realized that I knew by the vanity plates who the person was driving the car.

The voice explained that the car was about to go got of control and speed into the center median. Then the person driving would over-correct and speed across the interstate in front of me just in time for me to T-bone the car and kill both of us. The voice told me to simply take my foot off the gas and coast...that would slow my car enough to avoid hitting the car and the semis behind me would not hit me. Just exactly as the instructions were completed I took my foot off the gas and the entire scene played out before me. The car started running off to the left into the median kicking grass up and speeding toward the steel barrier...at 1st I thought it would be sliced in 2 right down the middle, but then the driver began to swerve back into my lane.

823,OBE,1521,43,,F,"I had a two part experience with this series. I had an OBE with the first and fourth meditation. In the first meditation I experienced a dropping down into my heart. Once that happened, I felt myself leave my physical body. I found myself in the rings of Saturn. I observed this area for a bit. I could feel something like wind and could hear the planet rotating. I watched as rocky material went by. I say watched, but it wasnt like watching with your eyes. I felt like I was going in a circular motion and felt like I was standing, but not really standing. I shifted my consciousness to look down because I felt like I had moved from the rings to somewhere else. I found my consciousness in the middle of the DNA helix. It seems like I stayed there for quite awhile and could feel a sense of awe. I felt in awe throughout this whole experience. I then found myself sort of floating in what felt and looked like darkness, but not scary darkness more like space darkness. I became aware of a shape, but it was on a mammoth scale. There is nothing that I can even compare it to. It felt like God, OM, greatness. I was then in the middle of what seemed like what would be comparable to the bloodstream. I was moving very fast and saw lots of red around me. This shifted from the bloodstream to the galaxies, other planets, humans, animals, trees, everything. I felt like I was being shown that everything is connected and on an even larger scale, we make (everything) actually makes up God/OM. We are the heart, everything is about the heart. In the 4th mediation I had a similar, but different experience. I dropped down into my heart again, but I stayed there for a bit. I had the sensation that I was laying on my left side. I could hear a muffled heart beat. Not a perfect beat and it sounded as if it may even be skipping beats, but so comforting. I became aware of the feeling of warm fluid all around me and inside my nose, lungs, mouth. I could see my right hand, but it was very tiny and very pink. It was mostly dark, but a little bit of white light was around the edges of this space. I felt as if this was me and I was in my mothers womb. I remember feeling the most comforted I ever have. It was so comforting, but also very confining, but not in a bad way. From there, I felt like I was in a white light spiral. The spiral shot the purest white light through my heart and out of the crown of my head-simultaneously. My consciousness catapulted out of my chest, but also through my head. Up, straight up and fast, but completely enveloped with white light and love. I felt like there were beings that were moving with me, supporting me, but they had no physical characteristics. They were pure light.    ",,American,"25,000",spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,never,very strong,littl,"0 24,999",High,Yoga st,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult
824,ME ,1067,33,,F,"I prayed for probably 3 4 months, as I continued to read the Course and do the workbook. Suddenly, literally out of the blue, one day I had an encounter with my boss where I felt blamed for something that wasnt my fault. He said something to me, and I responded in a really defensive way. The moment I spoke my response to him, I felt the left side of my scalp tingle. Not just a tiny tingle, but the ENTIRE left side of my scalp really tingled like the way you might imagine it feels when a cats hair stands on end. During this encounter with my boss, I was fully aware something strange had happened on my scalp...but I was too wrapped up in the defensive discussion to really pay that much attention to it. Later on the same day, I had a negative thought about something else, and this very strong tingle thing happened again. Very shortly, I realized what seemed to be happening was that my prayer had been answered...I was being shown without question, which of my thoughts had a negative component to them by having this very strong tingle each and every time I had one! This amazed me, and still does to this day. For the next several months, I got used to this feeling and played around with it. It happens without fail, when I have any thought that violates Gods (or our own) nature. If my thought is really big, the tingle is really big and covers the entire left side of my head. If my thought is smaller, a passing thing, the tingle will still be there...only reduced to a tiny tingle on mostly the top of the left side of my head. As I worked with this feeling, I learned very quickly how to avoid the types of thoughts that would make the tingle happen. At this time, I rarely have the tingle...ie: I have trained my thought process to be much more loving. The tingle is still there very strongly if I slip up, however. I can also make the tingle happen on purpose, simply by deliberately thinking about a very negative or hateful emotion. I thought this was interesting in that it is something I can do at will, as well as it being there to warn me off bad thoughts when I havent been trying.

842,ME ,1009,18,,F,"One of the weirdest things about this experience was the feeling of getting shot in the head. Actually, I didnt feel a thing, but I remember how my vision exploded in red. I remember how I vaguely felt my body hitting the ground and being unable to stop it, even as I, as a spirit, got yanked out of my body. I didnt feel a bit of pain, and Im usually very scared of blood, but I wasnt scared of the blood I saw coming out of me as I died--just intrigued, but not emotionally connected to it. As a spirit, I learned that I look very different than how I look physically. This experience taught me that I, Theresa, am actually a combination of three women who I was in other lifetimes--and I learned that we dont have to live our lifetimes in chronological order, and those lifetimes can overlap on each other, too. I learned that I, Theresa, am a combination of these three women:-a German Jewish girl who was about sixteen when she died in one of the concentration camps during the Holocaust-an American (Caucasian) woman who was in her 30s when she died in the 1980s-a Caucasian woman with shoulder-length, flaming red hair who was the captain of a starship and had died in the 2300s or thereabouts. She was in her late 20s-early 30s. Id lived all three of these lifetimes before this one. I learned that I, Theresa, am a composite of all three of these women. Im not exactly my own person. Im unique, yes--but I was created from these three women. Looking back on whats happened in the 2000s in our physical world, Im astounded that I basically saw our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan several years before they happened. Back in 1998, it was a lot easier to dismiss this experience as some really vivid dream, emphasis on dream. When I was 18, I couldnt fathom circumstances when the US would choose to wage war against anyone else. It was really easy to dismiss this aspect of my experience as something out of an action movie, perhaps. And I distinctly felt what the other soldiers were feeling--this grief over the fact that they knew, at the time of their deaths, that they would be dying so far away from home for a pointless war. The soldiers in my dream knew this full well as they died. They were extremely sad about this. If I had to describe it, it was like they had this immense, low, wailing grief--something very heavy and sad, like low, gray storm clouds. Back in 1998, one of the things that really amazed me was that the littlest promises we make are, indeed, kept. To go back to this brother of mine: We were fans of James Camerons movie, TITANIC, and we met in an email mailing list. We ended up talking a lot via IM. I dont think we ever exchanged pictures, even. But he was the first to say that he felt like I was his little sister, which was odd because he is an only child, like me. He liked calling me Sis a lot, and I called him big bro, although I dont think I felt this sibling bond quite as strongly as he did. We did talk about the supernatural, and about life beyond death. He talked about being in the US Army for some period of time. I dont know how our conversations got to this point, but we made a promise to each other: that if it really was true that there was life beyond death, whoever would die first would go to the other person and be there for them when it was their time to die. In the case of my experience, I died first and, as promised, I visited him--even if I, at least, had completely forgotten about making this promise in the first place.

850,ADC,1290,62,,F,"On January 4, 2007, I was alone in the kitchen of my home in Ossining, NY. My husband was upstairs working. I like my home orderly and keep everything in its place. It was daytime and I was preparing some food when my eye caught an object by the floor. I looked down and saw a little white square paper wedged up against the dark green backsplash runner by the floor. I picked up the paper. It was actually an empty little envelope with a gold lining inside. The envelope looked like it was opened after it was sealed because it had a rip in the flap. It was the kind of gift envelope that contained a card with someones name on it that youd give with a gift at Christmas. On the front of the envelope was the hand-printed word Dad. It looked like my handwriting but I didnt remember giving my father this envelope in the 2 1/2 years we were communicating just before his passing, and we didnt talk to each other for 29 years previously. In my home, a random and obscure object just doesnt turn up mysteriously in a strange place like that. I stood there with a shocked feeling, staring at the envelope. I thought I knew it came from a spiritual source but I wasnt ready to accept that. I had to rule out all possibilities. I called for Hank to come down and showed him the envelope. I asked if it was his. He said no. I asked if he ever saw this before. No. Could he imagine where it came from? No. I asked if it fell out of the newspapers he recycles in the kitchen. He said no. I told him where I found it and that it came from Holy Spirit. Hank became agitated and got a little angry. He was annoyed that mysterious, spiritual things like this were happening to me and darted back upstairs to his office. I stood there looking at the envelope and asked out loud: Dad, are you here with me now? Suddenly, a brisk wind came across my bare shins and I felt the chills. Then I knew my father was with me. I wanted to know more about this mystery, so I called a cousin of Hanks who was a Deacon at a Catholic Church in New Orleans. I asked Gary what all this meant. He said that God made my father my Guardian Angel and that my father would be watching over me. This was awesome. Although I had had a love/hate relationship with my father, I just loved him now and was happy to know he was with me. I have fond, loving memories bonding with my father in my childhood and enjoying life with him. (Im uploading a photo of this envelope.

852,ME ,1269,59,,F,"(Repeat of #43) I was driving my car alone and running errands during the daytime. It was an ordinary, sunny July day during the week. I was driving past the Briarcliff Congregational Church in Briarcliff Manor, New York, a small, Westchester County suburban community, a one-hour drive north of Manhattan. I glanced over at the churchs directory sign to read it. It said You say theres distance between you and God. Who moved? I immediately stopped my car and held up traffic, stared at those words and thought for a few seconds about that question. I remember answering that question to myself: I moved. It was I who moved because God doesnt move. Hes all around us. I suddenly realized what I was saying and I said to myself: Why am I answering this question? I dont believe in God. Then I started to cry and I was shaking in my car. It was a soft cry and a mild shaking. But I was aware that I was being moved by something. I heard the car horns blaring behind me but ignored them. I knew I had to make an instant decision to stay with this feeling or cut it off, ignore it and continue on with my chores. Although I was a little frightened at the unknown feelings and event that were overtaking me, I decided to stay with my feelings. I pulled across the street into the empty parking lot of the little Briarcliff Public Library and parked in a quiet corner of the lot. I sat crying and shaking and let whatever it was overtake me. I was still a little frightened but I decided to trust the event. I suddenly looked down and saw that my chest was ethereally slowly opening up and a current of wavy air was entering my chest. This did not at all frighten me. I did not hear anything, touch anything or smell anything. (With me, all my visions, signs and visits by Holy Spirit were always visual. I guess since God made me a visual artist, It comes to me in a visual form.) God then played with me a game of spiritual connect the dots. It released from my memory spiritual experiences from my past that I had heretofore forgotten but remembered when they became fresh again in my memory. (Ill be registering each one in separate forms on your site.) I was sitting in my car for about one half hour and in that half hour I went from believing nothing to believing everything. I knew there really was a God. I knew that Jesus was the Son of God. I knew there really was a Holy Spirit. I knew the Bible was true. And I felt that God wanted me to be Christian, so I converted myself from Judaism to Christianity on the spot. No one came over to me while I sat in my car.

And HERE is the most remarkable, profound, and intense part of this experience: Despite their important work of apparently saving a large population, when I arrived there, they both turned their full attention to me. Here, words truly lose their meaning. I have great reverence for these two men and the work they were seemingly doing, yet despite this they afforded me their full attention and admiration and love. They were happy to see ME! But it was so much more than that. I felt all of the infinite and unconditional love of the universe, the acceptance, everything Dr. Eben discussed in his book, if I may use that cop-out in lieu of attempting to describe the indescribable.  At the time, I had been dealing with being disrespected as a new EMT in a culture that big on attitude and tradition and small on respect. I learned one of the most important lessons of my life in that moment: That every being on earth is greeted with %1,000 full attention, love, admiration, and acceptance by God, with no regard to anything else thats going on. I cant fathom how its possible to everywhere and doing everything at once, despite the fact that I experienced beings capable of that while making me the center and sole focus of all that infinite love.  I clumsily and, I feel, stupidly introduced myself as Josh, from Oregon, as though that would have made sense. It did, apparently. As we all floated above this world with refugees down below, information was exchanged. There was a discussion. I do not recall nor did I upon waking- that discussion that was shared between the three of us. I was there to experience what I had upon my arrival. My mother, whom I was best friends with, died in 2002. My family was shattered, but I was the apple of my mothers eye. Her death is something that I still havent dealt with fully. I sense that this was at the heart of that exchange, however it was with some other part of me that I dont have access to right now.  When this conversation concluded, whatever it was, I remember making the journey back to my body. It was the exact same immeasurable distance, yet the time it took was very... well, there was no quick or slow about it. It just was. When I arrived back to my body, I snapped awake.  I immediately called my father who had been close friends with Pir Vilayat. My dad was very supportive and receptive, even happy that I had such a special dream.

867,ME ,1302,51,,F,"Sometime in 1996, I was sitting alone in my office in my home in the middle of writing my memoir novel. I was sitting in my chair, thinking at the time. Suddenly I saw a vision in my head that Im entitling Our Human Timeline of Existence. It was a horizontally long image running left to right in my head. There were no words, numbers or sounds, only images. At the left of this horizontal Timeline was the first image. That image was of an ape down on all fours and facing left. To the right of that ape and facing right was a second ape starting to stand up. To the right of that ape and facing right was the third ape, looking Neanderthal. To the right of that ape was a picture of a human being facing right. Then there was a little space. To the right of the space was the image of Leonardo da Vinci\xe2\x80\x99s Vitruvian Man. To the right of that was a very, very long empty area. At the right end of the Timeline, the last image, is a great gust of horizontal wind blurring out the whole right end of the Timeline. That was what I saw. There were no dates on this Timeline. I thought about that vision and why I was seeing it. According to the spacing of the images one to another on the left and then the very long empty space in the middle area and then the wind blur all the way on the right, the vision said to me that, according to where Vitruvian Man was standing in the Timeline, we humans are currently (the 20th Century) into about 20% of our survival, from our beginnings on Earth to our end. I couldnt see our end because that was where the horizontal wind blur was, which took up all the space on the right side. There were no dates, so I dont know how it would happen to us, when, or if it would even happen at all. What I do see is that we humans have many, many more millenniums of survival. I believe I saw this vision and I believe (kinda) in what it was telling me. I wasnt sure what I was supposed to do with this knowledge except to tell people. But since that was one of my first spiritual experiences, I was so new to God (but still an atheist), that I think I told one other person. I wasnt confident in what I saw and I didnt want people to think I was crazy. Im uploading a file of the picture I drew of this vision. I dont remember what day I actually saw it because I wasnt writing down my spiritual experiences yet. So I recorded my vision in this picture at a later time, June 19, 2006.

871,DEE,1205,45,,F,"Well it has been a few years, but here is what happened. I was at Mass. We attend weekly. This week, for some reason, my eyes kept being drawn towards the rafters above the altar. I kept feeling a presence, actually two, playfully going from rafter to rafter. Ive felt presences before, never at church. Whenever I do, I usually just ignore, or if it is strong enough, tell it to call on the name of Christ. So the feeling kept getting stronger and stronger, I finally stated silently for the things to play quieter so I could concentrate on the Mass. They didnt leave though. And we lined up for the Holy Eucharist, and I received the Body of Christ from Rita, a long time parishoner and dedicated Eucharistic minister. As soon as she gave the Host to me, I didnt even get to walk to my seat when I heard a loud CRASH! The silver bowl witht the Host was dropped because Rita collapsed and died on the spot. As soon as that happened, I slowly felt the presences leave. Come to find out about a week later at Ritas funeral, that she used to be a nun, she was in love with the Eucharist, and her life-long wish was to die IN THE CHURCH, GIVING OUT THE EUCHARIST. Those angels in the rafters (or whatever celestial beings they were) were there for Rita. I only observed, or felt their presence. This isnt the first time Ive felt unearthly presences, but most definitely the strongest.

878,DEE,1541,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

882,DEE,1046,35,,M,"few weeks ago I had a powerful experience. I wouldnt call it a dream. I needed to write it down so I can remember the full intensity of the experience. Also to be able to reflect upon it, both now and in the future.        It has taken me sometime to get it all down; I have laboured to get every moment, every feeling, every thought that I had during it down on these pages- there was a lot to it. Its taken upwards of three weeks to get it all down completely. The experience started with a prayer to God I made the night previous. The prayer was; To show me a path out of my dilemma, and to show me how I got to be where I am now. I went to sleep that night and then I found myself in a familiar room from my past. I found myself in a spectacular room packed with Christmas presents, Christmas ornaments, and a Christmas tree. All unique in the fact that they were all composed of the same colours; black and silver. It was beautiful. It was breathtaking. It was simply astounding to be in the room.        I have a memory of being in that room, long, long ago, possibly even prior to my birth into this world. I remember being in the room and playing with many other children there, all of whom were equally astounded to be there. After playing for a while in this room the adults there began to give away Christmas presents to all of the children. I received my FIRST Christmas present there. I watched, as the other children opened their boxes and they received all kinds of toys, exquisite clothing and other gifts that were extraordinary to be sure, but I chose to wait till the end of the presentations to get my box towards the last. At my turn to receive a gift, what I found inside my box was a small floating glowing crystal.  The adults there asked me if I wanted it. I remember looking at it with intense curiosity. It shone brightly in silver, and then would fade to black- but even then when it was completely black, you could still discern that it was a beautiful crystal. Then after awhile it would lighten, it would become black for a while and then it would become somewhat silver, and then fade back some then again silver and then again black. Sometimes completely black and sometimes brightly silver. Some of the other children had received this type of crystal, as well, in their first Christmas presents. All of the crystals were similar, but each shone and faded at different intervals and for different periods of time. I examined some of the other lucky childrens crystals, some shone brightly silver most of the time, others would shine and then fade at regular intervals, others were erratic- shining and fading at seemingly random intervals. All were beautiful and all looked extremely fragile. All of the other kids who had not received a crystal were jealous of what the lucky children had received. It was like they had not passed some type of a test of character and they were not yet ready for this type of a gift. Again, the adults there in the room with me expressed some doubt, and asked me if I wanted my present? Again I looked and compared my crystal with what the other lucky children had, my crystal with this second look seemed somehow defective. My crystal had long periods where it would be completely dark, several periods where it would be between dark and light, and very short periods where it would shine brighter than any of the other crystals. Then it occurred to me that this wasnt a defective crystal at all, but in fact, a unique crystal that was completely different from any of the others that I had seen. I said yes- I wanted my present, and this present, this present of this oddly glowing and fading crystal was actually the gift of a life in this world. I got my life out of it. The other lucky children got their lives out of their crystals as well, each life different from the next.        This time, now, that I was in the room, everything was the same except there were no other children here. I was equally astounded to be in this meticulously decorated room and yet, I had a sense that I didnt want any of it. That it was just a memory from long ago, and that having matured to middle age- I didnt want any of it anymore. It was like the passing of a stage. How many of the other children had settled for the shiny wrappers and the electric thrills, ornamental clothing and toys, and I, like a few other lucky ones, had waited till the last and received the most precious gift of all- a life, and now I didnt want mine anymore!  And from here I felt I had passed a stage into another room up above the room I had been in. I was lifted up on a strange device that swung me back and forth, gradually upwards towards this other room further up above.

884,ME ,1269,59,,F,"(Repeat of #43) I was driving my car alone and running errands during the daytime. It was an ordinary, sunny July day during the week. I was driving past the Briarcliff Congregational Church in Briarcliff Manor, New York, a small, Westchester County suburban community, a one-hour drive north of Manhattan. I glanced over at the churchs directory sign to read it. It said You say theres distance between you and God. Who moved? I immediately stopped my car and held up traffic, stared at those words and thought for a few seconds about that question. I remember answering that question to myself: I moved. It was I who moved because God doesnt move. Hes all around us. I suddenly realized what I was saying and I said to myself: Why am I answering this question? I dont believe in God. Then I started to cry and I was shaking in my car. It was a soft cry and a mild shaking. But I was aware that I was being moved by something. I heard the car horns blaring behind me but ignored them. I knew I had to make an instant decision to stay with this feeling or cut it off, ignore it and continue on with my chores. Although I was a little frightened at the unknown feelings and event that were overtaking me, I decided to stay with my feelings. I pulled across the street into the empty parking lot of the little Briarcliff Public Library and parked in a quiet corner of the lot. I sat crying and shaking and let whatever it was overtake me. I was still a little frightened but I decided to trust the event. I suddenly looked down and saw that my chest was ethereally slowly opening up and a current of wavy air was entering my chest. This did not at all frighten me. I did not hear anything, touch anything or smell anything. (With me, all my visions, signs and visits by Holy Spirit were always visual. I guess since God made me a visual artist, It comes to me in a visual form.) God then played with me a game of spiritual connect the dots. It released from my memory spiritual experiences from my past that I had heretofore forgotten but remembered when they became fresh again in my memory. (Ill be registering each one in separate forms on your site.) I was sitting in my car for about one half hour and in that half hour I went from believing nothing to believing everything. I knew there really was a God. I knew that Jesus was the Son of God. I knew there really was a Holy Spirit. I knew the Bible was true. And I felt that God wanted me to be Christian, so I converted myself from Judaism to Christianity on the spot. No one came over to me while I sat in my car.

895,ME ,1269,59,,F,"(Repeat of #43) I was driving my car alone and running errands during the daytime. It was an ordinary, sunny July day during the week. I was driving past the Briarcliff Congregational Church in Briarcliff Manor, New York, a small, Westchester County suburban community, a one-hour drive north of Manhattan. I glanced over at the churchs directory sign to read it. It said You say theres distance between you and God. Who moved? I immediately stopped my car and held up traffic, stared at those words and thought for a few seconds about that question. I remember answering that question to myself: I moved. It was I who moved because God doesnt move. Hes all around us. I suddenly realized what I was saying and I said to myself: Why am I answering this question? I dont believe in God. Then I started to cry and I was shaking in my car. It was a soft cry and a mild shaking. But I was aware that I was being moved by something. I heard the car horns blaring behind me but ignored them. I knew I had to make an instant decision to stay with this feeling or cut it off, ignore it and continue on with my chores. Although I was a little frightened at the unknown feelings and event that were overtaking me, I decided to stay with my feelings. I pulled across the street into the empty parking lot of the little Briarcliff Public Library and parked in a quiet corner of the lot. I sat crying and shaking and let whatever it was overtake me. I was still a little frightened but I decided to trust the event. I suddenly looked down and saw that my chest was ethereally slowly opening up and a current of wavy air was entering my chest. This did not at all frighten me. I did not hear anything, touch anything or smell anything. (With me, all my visions, signs and visits by Holy Spirit were always visual. I guess since God made me a visual artist, It comes to me in a visual form.) God then played with me a game of spiritual connect the dots. It released from my memory spiritual experiences from my past that I had heretofore forgotten but remembered when they became fresh again in my memory. (Ill be registering each one in separate forms on your site.) I was sitting in my car for about one half hour and in that half hour I went from believing nothing to believing everything. I knew there really was a God. I knew that Jesus was the Son of God. I knew there really was a Holy Spirit. I knew the Bible was true. And I felt that God wanted me to be Christian, so I converted myself from Judaism to Christianity on the spot. No one came over to me while I sat in my car.

896,DEE,1205,45,,F,"Well it has been a few years, but here is what happened. I was at Mass. We attend weekly. This week, for some reason, my eyes kept being drawn towards the rafters above the altar. I kept feeling a presence, actually two, playfully going from rafter to rafter. Ive felt presences before, never at church. Whenever I do, I usually just ignore, or if it is strong enough, tell it to call on the name of Christ. So the feeling kept getting stronger and stronger, I finally stated silently for the things to play quieter so I could concentrate on the Mass. They didnt leave though. And we lined up for the Holy Eucharist, and I received the Body of Christ from Rita, a long time parishoner and dedicated Eucharistic minister. As soon as she gave the Host to me, I didnt even get to walk to my seat when I heard a loud CRASH! The silver bowl witht the Host was dropped because Rita collapsed and died on the spot. As soon as that happened, I slowly felt the presences leave. Come to find out about a week later at Ritas funeral, that she used to be a nun, she was in love with the Eucharist, and her life-long wish was to die IN THE CHURCH, GIVING OUT THE EUCHARIST. Those angels in the rafters (or whatever celestial beings they were) were there for Rita. I only observed, or felt their presence. This isnt the first time Ive felt unearthly presences, but most definitely the strongest. You can check on Ritas death if you want to confirm this, just let me know and I will give you the name of the parish and the presiding priest. Please keep me nameless, for now. Thank you.

904,SDE,1308,41,,F,"After I fell to the ground and my father was with me we chatted like normal, then all of a sudden he said we have to go and see my step-mother and brother. The whole time I experienced this the beautiful warmth and light was upon me, to describe the light as best I can, is like having a massive spotlight place over you and the rim of the light is pure white and protective, inside the light is the perfect warmth, like the temperature is set to perfection. As we walked over to my step-mother I said to her please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know this, I then placed my hand just under her left shoulder and just above her breast and said Dad wants you to know he loves you with all his heart and soul the look on my step-mothers face was shock and tears welled in her eyes. We then walked over to my Brother (who had a 20 yr feud with my sister) I said to him again, please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know, with that I then placed my hand over his stomach, and said Dad understands the feud between he and my sister is deep seated within them and could they please let the past be and find a way to love each other again, my brother was also shocked....I told him again, not to be afraid. After I gave these messages to my family, we walked over to a rose garden, the whole time the light was with me and the most beautiful, euphoric feeling I can not describe was with me. In between the messages I kept repeating to Dad how beautiful it was. When we sat at the rose garden, Dad asked me if there was anything they could do (we werent allowed to tell him during the week he was dying) I said there wasnt the cancer had spread to most of his body and I just kept also repeating Look Dad, look how beautiful it is I was just in awe of it. With that he was gone and I was back to reality. I returned to the motel we were staying at, thinking that the experience was spurred on by lack of sleep or stress. I thought I was losing my mind. Later that day I returned to the Hospital and was in the kitchen when a nurse came in and I told her that I thought I had lost my mind and was it normal when a loved one was dying, I told her about what I had experienced and thinking she would agree that it was stress induced, the nurse (Paula) then stated that is exactly what Dad would experience when he does finally pass. I was shocked. We both returned to Dads room only to find he was awake and outside in the courtyard, with two other nurses beside him. We couldnt believe it. He was telling my brother, as best he could as for most of the week it was hard to make sense out of much he was saying to us, he told my brother he had enough and then looked straight at me and said I have had enough Im ready to go because its beautiful isnt it buttons (a nickname Dad callled me) I was shocked but replied with a smile and said It certainly is Dad. The most wonderful calm came across me and I knew then everything would be alright. Paula (the nurse) then placed her hand on my shoulder and said, There is your confirmation. Later the next day, we all couldnt believe it when my brother and sister were standing in Dads room, hugging each other and genuinely sharing a laugh together. I then softly whispered in Dads ear, See Dad, you did it, I heard you and they are getting along now, everything is ok and you can go now. I know he heard me as I felt a weak grip on my hand as I was holding his hand.

There was LOVE, LOVE pouring off of him, streaming out of him in every direction, so much LOVE I couldnt imagine it. Its more LOVE than anyone could imagine exists and yet it did, and along with that LOVE was LIGHT the most intense but INVISIBLE LIGHT anyone could ever witness, it was invisible but it was as bright as bright could be. The intensity of the LOVE and the LIGHT flowing from this MAGNIFICENT BEING was beyond what my mind could grasp. I couldnt look at it, I turned my face slightly away, although this was all happening within me, I turned it slightly away because what I was seeing and what I was experiencing stunned my human mind, stunned it because the beauty of it, the transcendence of it and the LOVE itself was beyond human imagination. Then it was over. I will never forget it. Now, 35 years later, I still return to it in thought, it is still alive, it is still real.

(I\xe2\x80\x99d known I was gay for about a year, but\xe2\x80\x94happily\xe2\x80\x94the process of chasing girls wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really any different from what most of my friends were doing to chase boys.) After a half hour or so of chips and dip, Hawaiian Punch, and awkward attempts to impress our newfound objects of desire, we giggly adolescents settled down in our classmate\xe2\x80\x99s living room, and the Presbyterian minister began a simple talk about the parable of the sower. A few minutes into it, suddenly a huge presence\xe2\x80\x94way too big and powerful to be a product of my imagination\xe2\x80\x94was lifting me up and showing me, in a blinding flash of light and truth, that everything on Earth was contained within a sort of giant aquarium, which was itself part of a larger world where everything was filled with love and light. Suspended, just for an instant, above the sofas and chairs and paintings, I knew everything was going to be OK, and that nothing earthly was really very important in itself, due to the planet\xe2\x80\x99s position as a world within a larger world. A minute or two later, I tuned back in to the minister\xe2\x80\x99s talk, and he was on the last category of the sower\xe2\x80\x99s seed, that which fell on the good soil and yielded a hundredfold crop.

917,SDE,1278,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true.

918,DEE,1541,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

919,ADC,1434,45,,F,"Wish you were here. (a poem) You would love this place Dad, this forest mountain trail meandering past turquoise glacier lakes, cutting across a steep treeless loose-gravel scree. The path turns to switchback up a bare-dirt shoulder smoothed by winter\xe2\x80\x99s snow melting. At the crest, suddenly the view opens up expansive, to all horizons like the Swiss Alps. The whole Cascade range is carved at my feet: vivid green chasms, peaks painted white, no hint of civilization.  A pure sky of small cotton ball clouds streams from the horizon directly toward me, and I have to brace against this wild steady wind that spurs an endless herd of white stallions. Suddenly close and larger when leaping over this ridge, they tuck their legs at the last minute, skirting these wind-braced gnarled trees and my hand stretching up.  I used to tag along on your weekend hikes to places like this, your sanctuary. Me scurrying behind with little legs, trying to keep up with your tall, long easy strides. Death is the mystery, but I can sense you here now, Dad, in the mountains. Forgiveness allows my heart to expand; love created this place and is greater than space and time.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t hike like you did, I mountain bike. I pick up my machine here to ride back down, put on a helmet and earbuds for my Ipod. Swooping down the trail weaving through banked turns, speed and reactions are too quick for thought: rocks, a few feet of air. Me and two wheels quietly carve turns around huge ancient cedars skyscraper tall, their wizened moss-bearded branches sleepily brush puffy mist above. A postcard-intense azure sky between their reddish-brown trunks. A rush flying weightless through adrenaline-fueled bliss, this is my cathedral.  As I ride, a favorite song by Incubus always makes me think of you. It has become my prayer, telling you I am ok now.   I dig my toes into the sand,   the ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket   I lean against the wind   Pretend that I am weightless   And in this moment I am happy.   I Wish You Were Here\xe2\x80\xa6.     I lay my head onto the sand.   The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it.   Im counting ufos.   I signal them with my lighter   and in this moment i am happy,  I had a rare chance to visit your grave, passing through on my motorcycle. So many years ago this dot on a map, a hiccup in a straight flat line, was the stifling world I escaped at eighteen. Now its just a hot, dusty-small, freeway town. Surreally, everyone is a stranger. An earlier self\xe2\x80\x99s memories are just a story, gratefully too distant for emotions. The gravel road turns behind juvenile hall where I waited for my new foster mom after you died. The tiny catholic cemetery holds a few hundred family histories, a white, white statue, larger than life, divides two centuries. Mary, weeping, holds tortured Jesus in her lap. I know, neither one of us is Catholic, but mom was. I park the motorcycle. One key with one fob, a little silver disc etched with three lines one side, three broken lines the other; I-Ching symbols for Heaven and Earth.  Two unkempt, neglected yellow rose bushes grown mis-matched almost cover your name, so I trim a few branches. Ive never believed a spirit is buried, you are not here. But this is the last place on earth our paths intersected, so where else to go? No dates on the stone, I am sorry. I was too young to remember when the funeral home asked. But I am ok now.  You would be so proud of your beautiful granddaughters. The best of all of us, together.  You would like my husband, my soulmate. With him I\xe2\x80\x99ve surfed tropical waters with whales and turtles, biked Canadian passes, found love. Your spirit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to carry the burden of our grief anymore. I am no longer in a place of confused tears. Not even here. This sunny day.  Birds practice their songs above me, sitting back on an old tree; leaves quietly stirring sunbeams. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the Hispanic graves, decorated like a party. A family has recently left, spending a few happy hours with a beloved. Shiny balloons gently sway in the breeze.  Its a relief to share the peace we both so desperately needed so long ago. Then thoughts of the remaining day start to impede. A grocery list of errands, people to visit, hours on a clock, all interrupt me to leave. From the cool mowed grass I pick up my smartphone filled with facebook and emails, then in my hand the phone plays Wish You Were Here.  Dad. Are you telling me youre ok now too? I put the phone down to be here, a little while longer.  Love is greater than space and time.

925,DEE,1293,61,,F,"On August 20, 2006, Holy Spirit visited me. I was creating beaded jewelry that I sold at different outlets. I had finished a line of bracelets and cleared off my beading table, and put away all my beads, to make room for a new line of bracelets I wanted to make. I walked away from the table but when I returned, I saw in the middle of the cleaned-off area a Christian cross made up of small, clear glass pebbles. You know, the kind that are rounded on one side and flat on the other side. I liked these clear glass pebbles and kept a glass of them on my beading table to look at and to play with. The cross was positioned on the table askew--1:00 / 7:00. The lines of the glass pebbled cross were absolutely perfectly straight. The long part of the cross was made up of all one side of the pebbles while the short part was made up of the other side. I stood there and just stared at the glass cross. For the first few seconds, I was in a mild state of shock. I searched my brain to see if I had done that and forgot, but no. I thought if Hank might have done it but didnt think he would have. Then I knew where it came from and got the chills. But I had to eliminate Hank just to be sure, so I called him in. I pointed to the cross and asked if he did this. He stared at the cross and said no. I told him I didnt do it either. I told him that Holy Spirit did it. He didnt say anything about this. We looked at it some more and then went back to work.

There was LOVE, LOVE pouring off of him, streaming out of him in every direction, so much LOVE I couldnt imagine it. Its more LOVE than anyone could imagine exists and yet it did, and along with that LOVE was LIGHT the most intense but INVISIBLE LIGHT anyone could ever witness, it was invisible but it was as bright as bright could be. The intensity of the LOVE and the LIGHT flowing from this MAGNIFICENT BEING was beyond what my mind could grasp. I couldnt look at it, I turned my face slightly away, although this was all happening within me, I turned it slightly away because what I was seeing and what I was experiencing stunned my human mind, stunned it because the beauty of it, the transcendence of it and the LOVE itself was beyond human imagination. Then it was over. I will never forget it. Now, 35 years later, I still return to it in thought, it is still alive, it is still real.

927,ME ,1301,40,,M,"March 1991 had a Thursday fall on the 21st and 28th, and the next Thursday was April 4th. The significance of these dates to me is that one of them was likely the day that I was invested with a powerful message in which the reign of God was revealed to me in no uncertain terms, within the fabric of a pointed admonition. The message came when I was awake. It came in the form of receiving the feelings of other people, to be exact, feeling the feelings of the hospital patients of the Lyons, NJ, VA Hospital. I had recently tried to volunteer at the Lyons VA, but had become discouraged after an incident in which I had been trapped outside in freezing weather with a nursing home patient who could not make it up the stairs to enter the VA clinic I was taking him to. The nursing home was a separate building from the main ring comprising the hospital, and buses shuttled the patients between them. When this patient could not get up the stairs I sat him on a bench outside, went inside, and called security because it was 22 degrees and blowing. The security guys tried very hard to find fault with my actions. I resented the accusations, and frankly, was not thrilled with my job, which essentially duplicated the \xe2\x80\x9cred shirts\xe2\x80\x9d job as a helper for the nurses. I wanted more patient interaction. I decided to stop volunteering. I was in alone that morning in my hot tub not far from the hospital, in Basking Ridge, NJ. It was probably a Thursday because I generally took Thursday off work, even back then. I remember having a sudden fleeting thought that it was a shame how the VA volunteer attempt had turned out. It was sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cno good deed goes unpunished\xe2\x80\x9d thought. I felt what people describe as the \xe2\x80\x9cdoor open\xe2\x80\x9d in my consciousness, in my head. I can only describe it as an odd sensation. And then poured forth into my consciousness were the feelings of all the patients in the hospital, at that time probably 800 souls. The feelings were anger, helplessness, desperation, fear, and loneliness, and probably more, but these were feelings showing the needs of the people who had them. They hit me like a ton of bricks. I was stunned. I have never felt anything so intensely before or since. The feelings lasted only a few seconds, I think, not long at any rate, and were gone. This experience, this message, which had many aspects, was beautiful, was efficient, and was obviously purposeful. I knew instantly what the feelings were, whose, and who had sent them. They were meant to tell me I had made a mistake. They were meant to tell me to go back and try again. They were meant to tell me that God loves those patients, and that He loves me. It was adapted to and respectful of my situation, which is that I am in an interfaith marriage with a non-Christian. It showed me that God lives outside of time and space as we know it, which explains a lot. In short, it was the greatest gift I have received from God, with the possible exception of my wife, whom I suspect was steered to me by Him. I was quickly able to deduce that if God loves me, no one particularly special or virtuous, He certainly must love everyone in the same way, just as we had been told from childhood. I was always a believer in God, but as a young man had found God inconvenient for a while, and I had come back to the church 15 years earlier in another episode which I suspected was a spiritual intervention. But, while I could swear with 100% certainty that I believe it was a spiritual experience, it was one you can think of as \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d, a compulsion to seek out a priest immediately, while this was a \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d one. There was no mistaking this message from God. I practically stopped breathing. It was a 20,000 volt shock, like grabbing a spark plug wire, and just as unmistakable. So what was the outcome? Well, I found another way to volunteer at the VA, one where I was more in contact with the patients. First I read to a group of nursing home patients for about 10 years, and then I began to do bedside visits. In a couple of years I began to find this very difficult as my patients began to die, and I fled by moving to another town and becoming a literacy volunteer. The hot tub message is the defining moment of my life, and I was not told not to talk about it.

928,DEE,1272,64,,F,"Hank and I vacationed every June at a resort in Lenox, Massachusetts. It was a week-long event that offered workshops to the many people who returned year after year.  For four years I gave a workshop called Conversations About God. This open forum invited people to talk about how they felt about God and about their spiritual experiences. It was not about religion, only God. We talked about the signs we received from God and about miracles we saw or heard in our personal lives. My goal for this workshop was for us to get close to God and to connect with each other. On Friday, June 26, 2009 at 1:45pm, I went to a room to conduct my workshop which was to start at 2:00. I was standing by the rooms door waiting to greet people as they arrived. A man walked up to me. He was a large man, about 62. He had white hair nicely styled...bald on top, longish on the bottom. He wore a geometric-designed tent garment that covered him from neck to knee. His face was clean-shaven with pink shiny cheeks. He had this powerful and pleasant look on his face. But I was struck by his face because it was glowing. There was an unmistakable glow coming from his face, as if a light was on inside his head. I could see that the glow was of a spiritual nature. I couldnt stop staring at his face and its glow. I asked this man if he was a minister. I was wondering if he was coming to my workshop for personal or professional reasons. He was friendly and said that he wasnt a minister but that he came for personal reasons. We chatted lightly while waiting for the rest of the people. Normally about 20-25 people came to my workshop but it was 2:00 and no one else showed up. We went inside and I set up chairs in a circle. One other man came. He was a regular participant who lived in Boston. We were friendly and teased each other because he was a Red Sox fan and I was a Yankees fan. By 2:10 I could see no one else was coming. I thought it was strange. Not even my husband Hank came that day and he came to all my other workshops. This man and I immediately locked into each other, talking. I dont really remember all that we talked about. That part of the conversation was blocked from my mind. The Boston man tried to talk with us but we totally ignored him, though not with malice, so he got up and left. The man and I continued our conversation. Then this stranger said to me, Youre an E.T. Master. I looked at him for a long while. I took him seriously, thats the strange part. Whats an E.T.? I was scared to ask this question because I kind of knew what ET meant and I was afraid to hear him say those words. He paused, staring at me, You know, an extraterrestrial. My spirit and my eyes were locked with his spirit and his eyes. Oh, I think I said. Im an Angel, he matter-of-factly said to me. I believed him. I believed everything he was telling me. I wasnt afraid of him and I didnt think he was crazy. I trusted and totally believed this total stranger. Thats whats so strange. I didnt even want to come up here, he said. I have work to do and a wife and children back home in Texas. I wasnt even planning to come to your workshop. I was sleeping but a loud noise woke me up so I looked on the agenda to see what workshops were scheduled. I saw your workshop and decided to come. Now I know I was sent here to see you. Whats your name? I asked. You can call me Fred. What work do you do? Im a CPA. What am I supposed to do? What are you saying to me? I dont understand. Are there books I should read? He looked away from me and said: You will be meeting people. They will show you the way. I dont remember what else we talked about in the one to two hours we talked. But I do remember that I was spiritually locked into him, like I was spiritually locked into the glow and cross and the ghost. He got up to leave and said goodbye. I said goodbye but I didnt get up. I couldnt get up. I was just sitting there, numb-like, just staring ahead. He stopped and turned around, Are you okay? Yes, Im okay, was all I could say. I sat alone in the room not really thinking about anything. Then I returned to Hank, told him a little bit about my unusual workshop but I didnt tell him then what Fred said to me. Later that night I saw Fred one more time at a dance our event put on. As soon as I saw him I went over to give him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and I said thank you. He smiled. He didnt say anything, though. We parted and I went back to Hank and we danced the night away. I remember looking for Fred in the dance room but I never saw him again. I regret not knowing his last name or not asking for his contact information. I tried to find out more about him so I could contact him but the organizers of the event couldnt help me without a last name.

932,OBE,1410,22,,F,"It really happened very very quickly. One minute I was watching tv and then I believe I had fallen asleep. All of a sudden I felt myself come out of my body and in a flash, my spirit, or whatever you want to call it, was out of my body, across the room, in front of the television. I saw the television and then I was just there, right in front of it. It was still on but I cant recall what was showing at the time this happened, I just know it was on and I could see it. I remember feeling this amazing sense of freedom and that I could go anywhere I wanted, as quickly as I wanted. I looked at the hotel room door and thought to myself, I want to go out there, see how far I can go like this. It was a very very pleasant and unbelievably exciting feeling, but I was also scared.  In that instant while I was looking at the door thinking about going further, reveling in this sense of freedom, speed and excitement, I suddenly I heard a voice (it wasnt a voice like we speak in the literal world, it was a voice that I could identify as male, I think, but instead of speaking out loud, it was like a knowledge in my head. Its hard to convey this correctly) saying If you want this to stop, you have to wake up now. I heard it and was still looking at the door. The voice/knowledge again said Sally, if you want this to stop you have to wake up NOW! with heavy heavy emphasis on the word NOW.  This time I listened and the next thing I knew, I was back in my body, sitting up and sucking in a HUGE gulp of air as if I hadnt taken a breath in a very long time, the same way you would if you were holding your breath under water for as long as you could stand and then surfaced. I was so scared of what I had just experienced I ran to the min-refrigerator, grabbed one of the beers from the six pack i had bought earlier, along with my cigarettes, and went outside where I drank the entire beer and smoked probably 4 cigarettes in a row. I was TERRIFIED to go back to sleep. I truly felt like I was going crazy and imagining what had just happened to me. When I finally went back to my room I stayed up as long as I could because I was afraid to go back to sleep and that it would happen again. At the time, I didnt want it to happen ever again. I finally did go back to sleep and slept peacefully the remaining few hours I had left before my flight. It has never happened to me again. I will be 40 this September, so its been almost 18 years since this happened and it has never happened to me again.

938,PLR,1006,31,,F,"I was meditating, as I had done hundreds of times before. All of the sudden, I had an experience that felt like a past-life experience. First, you should know that I am a petite female (52, very slender). But in my meditation, all of the sudden I was sitting on a horse and it was sometime around the 10th or 12th century. I was a large man. I could feel my heft. I was wearing a helmet and some kind of armor and vest that had a chain design of some sort. It was heavy.  I had just returned from war. I was going home to my wife and children. I was sitting on my horse, on a hill, looking down at the house towards the right. It was a very long single story house that had a series of very small windows that ran horizontally across the house, and it had a dark roof that looked like it was made of straw or some textured material. It was a dark color and I could see lights from candles inside the house. I knew my wife and children were in there, waiting for my return. I sat and looked at the house and had a feeling of sadness. I was happy to be home but I felt that this life was so hard, war was so hard. It was just a feeling of life being a burden, and feeling sad about all of it. The house was down towards my right, below the hill, and if I looked to my left I could see a harbor which is where I had some from. There were boats. I remember that it was very cold. And I remember that I could feel my heft. Like I could actually feel what it felt like to be that large. I knew what the name of the harbor was. Then all of the sudden I was standing on something that is hard to describe it was like a wooden platform or large wood cart with wheels and it was being pulled by horses. I was standing on it and holding the reigns while the horses pulled this thing I was standing on. We were entering a castle. I worked at the castle. I was some kind of fighter.

939,ME ,1301,40,,M,"March 1991 had a Thursday fall on the 21st and 28th, and the next Thursday was April 4th. The significance of these dates to me is that one of them was likely the day that I was invested with a powerful message in which the reign of God was revealed to me in no uncertain terms, within the fabric of a pointed admonition. The message came when I was awake. It came in the form of receiving the feelings of other people, to be exact, feeling the feelings of the hospital patients of the Lyons, NJ, VA Hospital. I had recently tried to volunteer at the Lyons VA, but had become discouraged after an incident in which I had been trapped outside in freezing weather with a nursing home patient who could not make it up the stairs to enter the VA clinic I was taking him to. The nursing home was a separate building from the main ring comprising the hospital, and buses shuttled the patients between them. When this patient could not get up the stairs I sat him on a bench outside, went inside, and called security because it was 22 degrees and blowing. The security guys tried very hard to find fault with my actions. I resented the accusations, and frankly, was not thrilled with my job, which essentially duplicated the \xe2\x80\x9cred shirts\xe2\x80\x9d job as a helper for the nurses. I wanted more patient interaction. I decided to stop volunteering. I was in alone that morning in my hot tub not far from the hospital, in Basking Ridge, NJ. It was probably a Thursday because I generally took Thursday off work, even back then. I remember having a sudden fleeting thought that it was a shame how the VA volunteer attempt had turned out. It was sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cno good deed goes unpunished\xe2\x80\x9d thought. I felt what people describe as the \xe2\x80\x9cdoor open\xe2\x80\x9d in my consciousness, in my head. I can only describe it as an odd sensation. And then poured forth into my consciousness were the feelings of all the patients in the hospital, at that time probably 800 souls. The feelings were anger, helplessness, desperation, fear, and loneliness, and probably more, but these were feelings showing the needs of the people who had them. They hit me like a ton of bricks. I was stunned. I have never felt anything so intensely before or since. The feelings lasted only a few seconds, I think, not long at any rate, and were gone. This experience, this message, which had many aspects, was beautiful, was efficient, and was obviously purposeful. I knew instantly what the feelings were, whose, and who had sent them. They were meant to tell me I had made a mistake. They were meant to tell me to go back and try again. They were meant to tell me that God loves those patients, and that He loves me. It was adapted to and respectful of my situation, which is that I am in an interfaith marriage with a non-Christian. It showed me that God lives outside of time and space as we know it, which explains a lot. In short, it was the greatest gift I have received from God, with the possible exception of my wife, whom I suspect was steered to me by Him. I was quickly able to deduce that if God loves me, no one particularly special or virtuous, He certainly must love everyone in the same way, just as we had been told from childhood. I was always a believer in God, but as a young man had found God inconvenient for a while, and I had come back to the church 15 years earlier in another episode which I suspected was a spiritual intervention. But, while I could swear with 100% certainty that I believe it was a spiritual experience, it was one you can think of as \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d, a compulsion to seek out a priest immediately, while this was a \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d one. There was no mistaking this message from God. I practically stopped breathing. It was a 20,000 volt shock, like grabbing a spark plug wire, and just as unmistakable. So what was the outcome? Well, I found another way to volunteer at the VA, one where I was more in contact with the patients. First I read to a group of nursing home patients for about 10 years, and then I began to do bedside visits. In a couple of years I began to find this very difficult as my patients began to die, and I fled by moving to another town and becoming a literacy volunteer. The hot tub message is the defining moment of my life, and I was not told not to talk about it. But speaking has its costs as well, one of which is that it seems to have so little effect on people, while it has revealed the Lord to me. Still, it did not make me into a saint, and I found I still struggle with the same failings that I had before. But it is a great blessing, surpassed only by those experiences in which people have felt the great unconditional love of the Lord for each of us.

945,ME ,1440,21,,F,"Dear Dr. Alexander, Thank you so much for your book, Proof of Heaven. I have not had a NDE, but I experience a variety of connections with/in my own body. I thought I would share them with you so that you might be able to incorporate these ideas and implications into the knowledge you now possess. Mini-bio: I am 32 years old, lesbian, a former college athlete, white, middle-class/U.S., non-religious. When I was in my teens, I was inexplicably drawn to spiritual books for the greater part of 2-3 years, and then that continued into college (previously, I detested reading anything). There was no explanation for this; I detested organized religion as well. I read books by Brian Weiss Many Lives, Many Masters; Charles Tart (actually flew to California to see him speak); Gary Schwartz, among many others. I found myself reading anything and everything I could find on reincarnation, psychics, NDEs, mystical ideas and the like. As I read more, it seemed like the reading experience was such that the more I read, the deeper I went into things I already knew...and that is what kept me reading. In part, I also think that I connected this knowledge with a more sociological knowledge of the body/spirit, particularly by way of sexuality since I was also, simultaneously, coming into the awakening of my sexuality and the relationship between aesthetic experience and physical sensation. For me, there was this immediate connection between sexuality and spirituality. At any rate, I went on in college to major in psychology, sociology, and religion/philosophy. I was one of the very few students in school that defended the reality of psi phenomenon, having never literally not really experienced it myself up to that point. I read the stories and just knew they were real. As I read more, and defended the idea more and more, I began to experience more in the way of expanded consciousness. All of this started shortly after this 2-3 year stint of reading. My clairvoyance is somehow limited by time; I know things are going to happen and Im informed of them, but only about 10 minutes prior. I receive information/images in the waking state in the form of symbolic interactions i.e. ideas are communicated by the meaning my psyche will construct if I cogitate about what very material relations actually mean or feel like specifically to me i.e. the particular is what carries the universal intent of the message/the lesson. In your terminology, I think that is my bodys way of adapting to the inflow of messages that it knows are from the outside. Most often, it goes like this: I will be receiving information that I can feel is information coming through and I will pay very close attention to the content because I know it is not just my own random thoughts (i.e. I would probably be a good receiver in telepathic studies). I will then obsess about what I can make of the structural relations of that content in the very context of my theoretical/sociological categories/knowledge...because it seems to me that it is in figuring out that puzzle that explains why it is that Im receiving that message. Sometimes I can figure out who it needs to reach. I guess this ties in with the quotation on your website that all thoughts and actions are interconnected...and that is true at every level. Story 2: Although it may have nothing or everything do with me, the night I was on my bed studying, crying, and mourning my deceased cousin who died the night prior she came to visit me by staging a physical impossibility... because she knew that would register to me (Im also a very scientific mind I see the possible by way of the impossible. My family makes fun of me for always asking for percentages and probabilities in all aspects of life). :) Anyway, the night prior to this, I remember the light bulb above my bed blowing out I could hear the filament hit the glass of the bulb. Nonetheless, I had left the light switch up/circuit open. As I was sitting there crying the second night, thinking about Beth, and feeling guilty that we had not connected more the year before when she requested that, the light illuminated in a fashion akin to those lights that very gradually get brighter/lighter by touch. It lasted for about 10 seconds. It illuminated in a way that is not possible given the type of light it is; it wasnt on a dimmer switch. And the visual was as if a blast of energy had simply traveled through the space. I know to a degree of 100% that this light bulb had totally and completely blown out the night prior. I was sitting in the exact same place. I immediately knew it was her, and was immediately brought to tears, again. I verbally thanked her. The next day I took the light bulb to a philosophy professor of mine who was very familiar with modern physics. He was a materialist.

Not him in the sense of physically being next to me, but this feeling of the love we shared, the grief I felt when I lost him, and replaying the experiences we had together. The thoughts of him flood my mind and almost become distracting. My mind would constantly wander back to thoughts of my grandpa and just intense deep feelings. (The first few times this happened to me was when my two of my grandpas brother died, my uncles father in law was dying and my aunt was diagnosed with cancer it wasnt until afterward that I pieced together my intense feelings surrounding my grandpa and the news). After I became aware of my grandpas presence its like I knew something was wrong, and he was trying to tell me or make me aware of something bad. Knowing something was going to happen was unsettling and my mind would race at the possible events that might happen. Then when my phone rang and it was news my uncle had had a massive stroke, it was instant that this what he was telling me. Knowing that my grandpa is here with me is something I can not describe in words...its a feeling you get deep in your gut that you know everything is going to be alright.

950,OBE,1373,39,,F,"I copy here the experience exactly as I typed it then. This records my third experience. The first one occurred in February of 1984 and then August, 1984. The third one in January of 1985, as written.  Jan.26, 1985--it has happened again (On what I experienced in early morning, only half awake). There was a rushing sound, a roaring in my ears. I am half awake now, with consciousness of my surroundings, and also have the feeling I am about to plunge off a cliff, a falling sensation. I feel, just briefly, a sense of immovability--the way in a dream one tries to move and cant, and also a sense of fear arises at this. Then the images begin, the feeling one of plunging deep into a vortex, but everything is vividly clear, in color. The images are against a black background, and they are perfect crystalline forms, changing constantly, that make me think of snowflake forms at times, then of those theoretical models of chemical components or DNA, and then of pure rock crystal forms. The speed of the images is way beyond me, their transformations occurring without cessation. Nothing exists but this silent world I seem to have entered, as the forms recede and accelerate alternately in the darkness. Then they stop--disappear, and what I see at a vast distance in total blackness, as if I were looking through a telescope backwards, only infinitely smaller than that, is a tiny circle of light. I see it as if I am looking into a cauldron of light, barely glimpsed at such a distance, but it shifts and flickers on the edges. Only a tiny part of it is revealed to me, but the light is so clear it is like the interior of a diamond--a dazzling light, that oddly conveys a sense, for which I cannot account, that it has a knowledge of some sort--as if the light was source. Then a tingling feeling occurs and the image ends--it all goes away, and I sense my regular surroundings again. I try to go to sleep. The first time this happened, last February 84, I was scared silly.  The images occurred after I experienced the same roaring sound, but at that time (also an early hour, between 2 and 5 a.m.) there was also a loud cracking sound; in fact, that happened first. The images were, then, not immediately visible. They appeared finally in the center of a deep blackness at a great distance in a curling, churning fire of light, and accelerated toward me until I could see the swirling changing crystal forms. I stayed up an hour afterwards, writing it down. I felt then the same tingling sensation at the onset and end of the event, and the same moment of immovability. The second time (all told, it has happened three times) was last summer, August, 84. And now this one, around 4:30 or 5 a.m. The fear was briefer; I knew more of what to expect, and it was as if I willed myself to hold on. I had been asleep, wake up to the buzzing, electric sensation, and the rest, and then it begins. I let the images come. In the times between the 3 events Ive tried to make it happen, unsuccessfully. Each time has occurred only spontaneously. Each time I feel I have encountered something with great energy or power within it. I feel it will happen again--that there is more to learn. Especially within that light. It frightens me, yet I sense it has meaning, validity. I wonder at its meaning, and seek it out.

The entire thing was made out of bone that had been polished. It was made from human bone! But for some reason this wasnt creepy at all. It was kind of like, the bones of the maryters or something? It was a way to honor them? Anyway, we were going in to check it out. I had a group of kids to watch, 4 or 5 of them. My daughter wasnt there as I remember, I think she had gone ahead. There were some boys who were slower and lagging from the general group so I stayed back with them to encourage them to keep going not to get so far behind. They moved along but something very strongly encouraged me to remain in that room for just a few minutes. We were in a small darker, cove like part of the Cathedral, there was an alter, seemed like lots of candles and gold and polished marble and polished bone inside the room. At the right to the altar where was an extremely intricately carved place, it was like the kind of carving you might see on an elephant tusk that the Chinese can do. But this was all people and scenes from the Bible. In the middle there was the nativity scene. Mary and joseph were there and baby jesus. I could see a teeny tiny well, with a pump. I stayed there waiting and then I heard a sound that was like a radio being dialed into tune, lots of static and voices. Finally one voice became clear. It was Marys! She had an accent! Like a very old one from a language that is not spoken anymore. But she spoke to me in English. She told me to pump some water from the well into this teeny tiny cup. So I did that, the cup was even smaller than a thimble. I wasnt sure what I supposed to do with it? Dip my fingers into it and make the sign of the cross like Holy Water? Or drink it? I didnt want to offend or do that wrong thing! She told me to drink it! But it understood immediately that it was to be just a small amount, I was not to drink the entire thing. This was for my own good, so that I would not become greedy. She said as I sipped some, This is soup. Nourishment for the world.

957,ADC,1363,25,,F,"I sat on the edge of the bed as Shawn tried to comfort me, my crying seemed to intensify with the downpour of the rain. I looked up at the ceiling in our bedroom asking God for a sign. I asked him as a Catholic, saying out loud: I have faith and I know they say he is in a better place, but I need MORE! I need PROOF that he is OKAY! And just as I shouted this at God a sudden loud bang and flash of white light filled the bedroom. Shawn and I physically jumped out of bed because the crash was so loud we thought the window was going to crash in on us. We looked at each other, puzzled. Was that for us? Because the timing was just as if God was answering my prayer. Just as that happened we began to calm down and the rain also subsided. I told Shawn that it felt like an answer from God and it was so strange. The next morning Shawn went out to our car that was parked on the street. He heard muffled music playing that grew louder as he got nearer. When he opened the car door the radio was blasting music very loud on my brothers favourite radio station. When Shawn tried to shut the radio off, it would not turn off, he had to pull the system out of its dock to make it turn off. The radio remained like that for years. The wires were fried because that night our building and our car was hit by lightening, the very lightening that crashed outside our window at the very moment I asked God for a sign / for proof that John was okay. That isnt the end of it. From then on it was like the floodgates had opened. I got all kinds of signs from John, all kinds of instances of after-death communication, including a full apparition, physical phenomenon, electronic phenomenon and I would like to share that all here.

959,OBE,1531,30,,F,"I must first start out by explaining that I have had OBEs my entire life, beginning when I was about 9 or 10 years old. It was at this age that I began watching tv programs about people being visited by their guardian angels, or other such spirits, who had saved their lives, or sent these people messages of some monumental significance.  I was very much affected by these programs and began praying to god, or to whoever was listening to me, for some sign of the \xe2\x80\x98other side,\xe2\x80\x99 because I knew deep inside that there was more to life and I wanted to experience it firsthand as these other people did. I prayed every day obsessively and even created my own Ouija board out of paper and a ring, thinking I could make some sort of connection. The ring did eventually move, to my astonishment, but it was just my own energy that I was becoming aware of. So I began to feel my own energy throughout my body, as I do to this day, although for some time I believed it was a spirit taking over my body because it felt so foreign at the time, and as a young child I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better.  Shortly after being aware of my own energy I began to feel my energy leave my body at night when I was falling asleep.  It was incredibly startling and disturbing, as it would jolt me awake, just as I was beginning to fall asleep. As I would awaken my energy would immediately slam back into my body. As a child I thought this was the devil taking my soul away, and I used to cry and pray to god at night. This happened all the time, and it was very frightening, and there was no one I could tell because I knew I would sound crazy. One night when I was crying and praying, I suddenly felt \xe2\x80\x93and had the image of- someone kissing my cheek. I felt the energy touch my face and sink into my skin- and then I felt an immense, overwhelming wave of intense love encompass my entire body, and I knew in my soul that I was loved and taken care of, that I was perfectly safe. I was in complete shock, and my tears turned to tears of joy- someone had responded to my prayers! I knew I was going to be ok! Somehow whatever was happening to me at night was not as horrible as I thought it was\xe2\x80\xa6and so I let it happen, knowing I was protected. I was so stunned by what happened-I had truly made a connection, the connection I had been yearning for. I knew there was more to this life, I knew there was nothing to fear, that someone or something was looking out for me. My fear of evil dissipated. I got used to feeling my energy leave my body at night, and it became a familiar sensation. Years later I would meet a friend in high school who would explain me that what I was experiencing was astral projection, and I would read books on the subject, as well as on many other metaphysical topics. As a teenager I would meditate and consciously expand my awareness, teaching myself to experience that profound love again and again, I would see auras, and have many other eye-opening spiritual experiences.  Throughout the years I have experienced OBEs in my dreams quite often, where I am flying around outside, in my house, out in space, all over the place. It is a fabulous feeling. I have not been able to consciously leave my body, though-only in dreams. As an adult I am very spiritual but I do not believe in any one religion or doctrine, nor in any god, heaven or hell, or in evil. I believe in my experiences, and in a profound and universal love that we are all a part of, not separate from, because of what I have felt and witnessed in my lifetime over and over again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 20 yrs old, and I was on lithium for 10 years when we come to the present time when this story unfolds, in July of 2013. There are many other events surrounding my experience I am to speak of, which are important to mention. At the time I most likely had lithium toxicity, as I was physically sick and severely confused, and my body was in convulsions for what seemed like weeks. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat very well on my own due to the spasms and it took me an immense amount of time to get dressed and perform normal tasks due to the uncontrollable spasms caused by lithium toxicity. I never knew what day it was it was or what had even happened the day before. I was in bad shape. At the same time I was also malnourished for reasons I can only speculate onmy boyfriend had recently broken up with me so I had fallen into a deep depression, I was hardly eating, forgetting to take my meds, and hardly sleeping. I most likely was suffering from a mental breakdown. I was 89 pounds, which was also caused by the fact that I was on adderall- I had already been underweight, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how in the world I had lost 10 pounds so quickly.

I went into the bathroom in this spirit form and saw a great statue perched on the closed toilet seat that looked like a statue but I didnt realize it was the angel of death but either way I didnt feel any fear from it. I saw some mini creatures that were about 2-3 feet in size going into the drain of the bathtub happily and willingly and as the approached the drain they would spin as if being flushed and I could see this great release on their faces and wanted to experience that same release too. So I decided to follow them and the moment I willingly resigned my soul for it to be permitted to be flushed down the bathtub drain I felt for the first time complete separation of myself from something that had always been with me but because I had never been without it I didnt know I had always had it...that was this connection to God. It was only in that vortex that I immediately knew I had made a mistake by stepping into that bathtub drain and called out to God and asked him to take me back to my body on the couch over and over but the tunnel vortex thing I was in spinning inside of and going deeper felt so isolated and I felt so alone and felt that my pleading and cries couldnt even be heard from God. Then the angel I had seen perched on top of the toilet next to the bathtub swooped down and caught me as I was decending in the vortex and I began to justify myself to God asking why would you permit the angel of death to personally escort me to Hell I am not a bad person?

973,ADC,1209,54,,F,"One night during my sleep, I had a short but very powerful dream. I could see my father walking on a treadmill and my mother, who is still alive, was there too. It seemed to be in their home, but all I could see was my father and mother. I looked at my mother and said, Is that dad? and she replied, yes it is. I walked over to him and he was dressed differently than normal. He had a funny looking sleeveless down jacket on. He was a man who liked to look nice and this jacket was just not him. He had this wonderful smile on his face and his being generated such great warmth. There were no words shared, but I could feel his love beyond measure for me. It was like our spirits were talking.

974,ADC,1514,40,,F,"I was sleeping with my 9 year old son, Connor. My brother, Tripp, came to wake me up to tell me that my step-mother had called to tell him my father had passed away. I believe the time was 2:36 a.m. or close to that. When Tripp whispered to my from the hallway, I immediately jolted awake. I knew why he was waking me. He told me that he was going to my dads house, but that I should not go. I went downstairs to tell my husband that my dad had passed. Looking back, I was very calm. I was not crying or upset. My dad and I had an extremely close relationship. I was wide awake, so it was not that I wasnt fully understanding, I just wasnt upset for some reason. I went back upstairs and quietly got back in bed so as not to wake up my son. As soon as I lay back down, I fell back to sleep with no problem at all. (Another thing that seems strange given the situation.) It seems as soon as I feel asleep, I wasnt really sleep anymore, but sitting on my couch at my own home in Savannah. I looked up from my couch down the hall to my front door. Our front door has glass panes in it. Through the panes, I could see my dad standing there. He looked young like he did when I was a little girl. He had on seersucker pants, a starched white shirt and a bright yellow tie. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I slowly walked to the door. Time seemed to go very slowly. He was patiently waiting and just smiling at me through the glass, his eyes never leaving mine. As I made my way to the door, I knew that he shouldnt be there. I also wondered how I got from the bed at my brothers house to my house in Savannah. I knew that he was gone and should not be here on earth. As I opened the door, he smiled, and said, Hey there, Sweet Girl...I promised you I would come back to see you in Savannah. I just stood there for what seemed like a long time and then slowly walked to him and started to hug him, but then I remembered the pain it caused when I hugged him because of the tumors in his abdomen. But he sensed my hesitation, and said, It is OK Sweet Girl. You cant hurt me anymore. There is no more pain. Then he walked through the front door, into my foyer and straight up my staircase where he just kind of vanished...I stood and watched him walk away, then I just immediately woke up, and I was wide awake, and the dream was as real and vivid as if I had just been standing at my front door. I was not groggy at all or scared or sad. I was so happy and comforted that he had come to me. I could still feel our hug. I looked at the clock and less than 40 minutes had passed since my brother had come in to tell me that my dad had passed away. I lay there for over an hour replaying the dream. Then as I was falling asleep, I begged and begged him to come back.

982,OBE,1238,34,,F,"Thank you very much for creating a space for these stories. I am very excited to tell mine. I am an artist and at the time I was transitioning from sculpture to painting. This extraordinary experience happened about thirty years ago.   One afternoon, before leaving for work, I decided to do a short meditation. I sat down on a carpet in my living room and assumed a meditation position. Moments after I closed my eyes, a clear blue window-like space appeared on the left side of the horizon. My conscious self became molecular, like a blip, or a tigle and I moved at the speed of light through the space. I first saw the edge of a sea. Beautiful sand edged the pristine waters which were gently rolling on to the shore. The area was completely clear of any vegetation or trees. I then found myself in the air, looking down at circular homes which were in a row. They were reminiscent of yurts or hogans. Then quick as a flash, I was inside, looking at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s back. She was tall, dressed in a black robe with crystals around her head. Telepathically I knew that she was a Priestess, a Healer. The Priestess was standing before an altar of some kind. Next, a small room emanating magenta light came into view. The room was translucent; the walls, ceiling, and floor emanated this gorgeous magenta light. Another room stood beside it, emanating a beautiful clear green light. Instantly I understood that these were healing rooms and that this civilization used color for healing and balancing the body.   I found myself outside, watching women and children playing on a hill. It was a bright sunny day and the children were laughing and chatting. On the hilltop there was a white stone post and lintel with three square colors atop the lintel. The colors were tints of the primary colors of red, yellow and blue. Every now and then a boy would run under the post and lintel to stand for a few moments. Then he would zip out to play again. I understood that this structure helped boys balance their chakra energy; it helped their energy flow without hindrance. Only the boys needed it; it was not necessary for the girls to do this.   Lastly, I found myself looking at the back of an old woman who was sitting on a bench. She was contemplating an exterior mosaic or mural that covered a long low wall. I approached this very colorful abstract wall. Soft sounds emanated from it as the colors moved and fused into each other. I knew that my gross ears could not hear the extraordinary beauty of the music that was created by the fusing colors. The wall was alive, changing into different configurations of beauty, much like a kaleidoscope. The old woman had created this beautiful wall and it was she who was responsible for bringing the concept of color healing into this civilization.      I re-entered my body with a great jerk and my eyes opened. I got up from my spot on the floor and went to work in a daze. There is no way for me to put into words how life changing this event has been. Seeing this beautiful world allowed me to understand the power and healing properties of color and sound. I continue to make art that will bring beauty and healing forces into our world.

983,ME ,1489,56,,M," By about nine p.m. I noticed that I was hearing songs in a way I never had before. I seemed to be entering more deeply than usual into the mind of the writer and understanding what was being emotionally conveyed. So I kept listening. I felt the sorrows and joys of others as they spoke to me in song. I felt the tragic beauty in the passions, lost hopes and brevity of life as experienced by other people. There was a collision of sadness and beauty, a kind of majestic sorrow. I wondered if it was due to being fifty six years of age and being able to relate to many situations in life. Shivers repeatedly rose in waves up my spine from its base. I could not recall ever enjoying music to such an extent. I identified so closely with the singers, I became them. I could get up and go to the bathroom or get a drink of chilled water from the kitchen without losing the spinal effect. I then returned to the headphones and Yahoo Radio on the computer. The shivers of pleasure continued to rise in waves up my spine and began to intensify and surge down my legs and up my arms. The base of my head, at the rear, where the spine joins the skull was hit by waves of exquisite sensation with each new song. It felt like a hand was gripping the upper back of my neck where it meets the skull, and channelling in high voltage pleasure direct to my brain. After each wave of energy up my spine, this sensation did not totally subside, but seemed to remain as a scintillation of increased magnitude higher than the level before it. I became concerned as the euphoric physical effects intensified and extended in duration. I checked my pulse by the clock to see if I had an elevated heart rate associated with panic attacks. My pulse was normal and steady and my body felt very, very relaxed. I had the sensation of settling or falling back, deeper within my body, as the experience continued. My mind was paradoxically calm, intensely present, sharply aware and my cognition totally functioning and nimble. The waves of sensation up my spine became a volcanic rush that entered my head. I was thinking \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Oh, Oh! Awesome! Go with it!\xe2\x80\x9d Rivers of energy flowed outwards along my limbs. By now it was after midnight. My body felt almost weightless. I felt immense power flowing through my body. At one point I looked at my hands and they felt so full of the sensation of energy and so insubstantial that I wondered if they might pass through the wall if I tried. I touched the wall out of curiosity and my hand was certainly still solid as it touched the wall! It was just that I could not feel my hand. It went on and on, hour after hour as powerful waves of surging energy, ever intensifying. I was totally immersed in intense ecstasy. Suddenly, there was another huge rush of energy upwards. There was complete darkness. I found my locus of consciousness now resting in the centre of my head as a tiny pin point. The room I was sitting in had totally disappeared from sight. It was dark and comforting in the centre of my brain. Then, there was a final atomic eruption I could feel rising beneath this tiny \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d, my centre of total awareness, and it burst forth from the top of my head carrying that tiny point in a massive torrent of energy that felt like a clear, cool viscous liquid, and my awareness emerged into a infinite yet intimate space which was like an endless ocean where I felt connected to all things in the cosmos. I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! I must have died! Oh well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d I had no fear. I was merely a point of consciousness with no body at all. I was overcome with immense gratitude for the privilege of having been alive, and for my life with its joys as well as its sorrows and the total improbability of just being. I thanked God.  Following on was an instantaneous, total life review. It was like viewing a three hundred and sixty degree panoramic picture screen with all of my life events played out simultaneously. Many of the things I had thought very significant in my life were not at all important. My preconceptions of right and wrong melted away. I did not feel judged in any way, I felt completely accepted. Everything was meaningful in my life and nothing I had experienced was wasted. The only things that now mattered in my past life were the times I had shown loving compassion to other people and living things. Then I felt enormous, limitless, feelings of joy, love, compassion and empathy for humankind and all living things. I felt intimate kinship with all humanity. I somehow was The Divine Mother with a heart for all my suffering beings and wanted to encompass them in arms of love and mercy and tell them everything was all right and always had been. Everything was perfect and always had been and always would be.

986,DEE,1295,5,,F,"I was about 5 years old. I was going through emotional trauma because my parents were divorcing and my beloved father had suddenly, without warning to me, and permanently left our home, leaving me to fend for myself with my withdrawn, unaffectionate mother and my older sister who hated me. One day I was leaving our 6th floor apartment to visit a friendly neighbor. I opened the front door but I stood on the threshold and couldnt go any further. I looked down the long dark hallway but I couldnt take a step off the threshold and out onto the hallway floor. Even though I walked down this dark hallway many, many times before, on that day I couldnt move. I was physically paralyzed. I tried to turn around to go back into my house but I just stood there unable to move. I couldnt move in any direction. My mind wanted to move but I couldnt get my body to move. Then a strange thing happened. I saw an ethereal mist surround me in the shape of a cocoon and it began to wrap itself around me, starting at my feet, going up and stopping at my neck. My whole body, including my arms, was wrapped in this mummy-like cocoon. It made me feel safe, protected and warm. It calmed me down. Then I got an idea how to break out of the paralysis. I suddenly put out my arms and began to twirl off the threshold. I twirled and twirled all the way down the long hallway. I remember my twirling became a habit because I was twirling in my home, in the hallways and in the streets. I thought I was dancing. I think that people thought I was dancing.

990,DEE,1247,25,,M,"I chanted HU (an ancient name for God on the path of ECKANKAR) after asking to see the ECK Master Rebezar Tarz. In a couple of moments he appeared in my inner vision, his head and shoulders. It was the most incredible experience I have ever had. It was more real than reality. It lasted perhaps a second, two seconds, but I will never forget it. I saw him in full living breathing color. I was looking at him in full conscious awareness, I was not asleep, I was awake. There was LOVE, LOVE pouring off of him, streaming out of him in every direction, so much LOVE I couldnt imagine it. Its more LOVE than anyone could imagine exists and yet it did, and along with that LOVE was LIGHT the most intense but INVISIBLE LIGHT anyone could ever witness, it was invisible but it was as bright as bright could be. The intensity of the LOVE and the LIGHT flowing from this MAGNIFICENT BEING was beyond what my mind could grasp. I couldnt look at it, I turned my face slightly away, although this was all happening within me, I turned it slightly away because what I was seeing and what I was experiencing stunned my human mind, stunned it because the beauty of it, the transcendence of it and the LOVE itself was beyond human imagination. Then it was over. I will never forget it. Now, 35 years later, I still return to it in thought, it is still alive, it is still real. I have had many many other spiritual experiences over the years but this is perhaps the most profound. Any doubts I had about the existence of Rebezar Tarz or other ECK Masters disappeared.

994,OBE,1392,22,,M,"This story is an account of an amazing venture into the future that came about by what I, years later, came to know as a Near Death Experience. Although I wasnt physically near death at the time, I experienced all the earmarks of a classic Near Death Experience, including leaving my physical body and traveling at tremendous speeds through a variety of mystical dimensions.   A Window in Time By Joe   The cold March rain dripped steadily off the back porch awning as I ran water for my morning coffee. Through the kitchen window I could see streaks of snow across the muddy back yard. Where the yard ended and the dark gray bark of maple trees along the hillside took over, the snow still covered all the land. The phone rang. Setting down the coffee pot, I reached for the phone. Hello. I said. You wanna meet for lunch? Jim asked without even bothering to say hello. Sure, I replied. Anything to get me out and away from the boredom. We exchanged a few more words and hung up. I put the coffee pot on the stove, grabbed a quick shower, put on a sweatshirt, poured myself a cup of coffee, and sat down to read a couple chapters from an Eric Von Daniken book I had just picked up the day before. A couple hours later, I put on a rainproof windbreaker and headed for town. When I arrived at Charlies Lounge, Jim was already there. Whats the special?, I asked the bartender.  Burger and fries, he said. Good enough for me, I replied. Put some cheese on it too. Jim looked over and smiled. You wanna beer? Ah, its a little early for that I said. Come on, one with lunch wont hurt you. he said. Get him a draught, he said to the bartender. Jim was a road construction worker who hadnt been working for the past couple weeks due to the incessant rain. Id known him since we were kids. His boredom wasnt as intense as mine, but the cold, dreary rain was getting a lot of people down in this tiny Pennsylvania railroad town. It was a tough little town along the edge of the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania. The heart of Appalachia was just a few minutes away. The Vietnam War was just winding down and Watergate was front page news every day. Life, like the weather, was bleak. A month earlier I had finished a two year stint as a Military Policeman in Germany.  I was accustomed to the excitement of constant stimulation. As a policeman I had weathered the drama and tragedy of the Munich Olympics, witnessed first hand the violence of the militant Baader-Meinhof Gang, and while wearing the white hat of law enforcement, had been front and center in the unpredictable and dangerous world of heroin addiction. Okay, Ill sip on a beer, I said to the bartender. Jim smiled. When I looked in his direction I could see a couple guys playing a game of pool. Immediately my radar went off. Two brothers were playing a game of eightball. One of the brothers was a year older than me, and had been a superb football player. The other brother was a year younger than me and had always been a bit of a troublemaker. And, he was drunk! It just past noon and he was drunker than a skunk. Several years earlier, I had been in an all out fight with the younger one. I had knocked him down and was on top of him, pounding the living daylights out of him when someone pulled me off.  Here he was again. Drunk, and this time with his older brother, who it appeared he was going to try and impress. He was staring at me. His face was getting red. I could feel my adrenalin surging. Every drop of testosterone in my body was lit up. The two years in the military had added 30 pounds of muscle to my body. I had been trained in judo and self defense techniques. I was capable of putting anyone into submission in seconds. I was ready! To avoid initiating any confrontation and to maintain my focus, I chose to gaze at the cue ball(the all white pool ball) as it bounded around the pool table. A moment went by, then two. I kept my focus on the cue ball. I began developing a slightly different mind set. I clearly remembering saying to myself, I choose to not allow my emotions to dictate my actions. I choose to just stay focused on the neutral cue ball. Then BOOM, it happened. Suddenly, without warning, my entire state of consciousness shot directly out of the top of my head. Everything I knew to be me was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and accelerating by the second. At first I seemed to have shot through a tunnel like zone, then into a brightly lit world. I went past cities, land masses, continents, entire worlds. and universes. I clearly remember seeing a great River. I remember thinking at the time that it must be the River that St John spoke of in Revelations. I remember clearly because, at the time, I was a dyed in the wool atheist. But I didnt stop there. I just zipped on by.

No heat, no cold. No emotion: no joy, no fear. Just calm awareness in a gray void. A moment / eternity passes. Light! A brilliant sun! And with it, darkness: the fullness of empty space. A small human figure stands in silhouette. My consciousness shifts. I become the figure; a human body standing in space before a radiant globe. I feel! I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished. I become aware that what had first appeared like a sun is un-like anything from ordinary reality. I am in the presence of a radiant, fluid luminosity. An amalgam of water and light is the best approximation I can think of. The sense of being before a conscious presence intensifies. My mind buzzes with the desire to hold It, to explain and contain It with my thought. The more I grasp, however, the more It slips away. It cannot be grasped or named. I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away. I become light. I am one with the light. I am the light, a fluid, radiant luminosity. I have no body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light. A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body.

I looked down the long dark hallway but I couldnt take a step off the threshold and out onto the hallway floor.

I tried to turn around to go back into my house but I just stood there unable to move. I couldnt move in any direction. My mind wanted to move but I couldnt get my body to move. Then a strange thing happened. I saw an ethereal mist surround me in the shape of a cocoon and it began to wrap itself around me, starting at my feet, going up and stopping at my neck. My whole body, including my arms, was wrapped in this mummy-like cocoon. It made me feel safe, protected and warm. It calmed me down. Then I got an idea how to break out of the paralysis. I suddenly put out my arms and began to twirl off the threshold. I twirled and twirled all the way down the long hallway.

1017,DEE,1046,35,,M,"few weeks ago I had a powerful experience. I wouldnt call it a dream. I needed to write it down so I can remember the full intensity of the experience. Also to be able to reflect upon it, both now and in the future.        It has taken me sometime to get it all down; I have laboured to get every moment, every feeling, every thought that I had during it down on these pages- there was a lot to it. Its taken upwards of three weeks to get it all down completely. The experience started with a prayer to God I made the night previous. The prayer was; To show me a path out of my dilemma, and to show me how I got to be where I am now. I went to sleep that night and then I found myself in a familiar room from my past. I found myself in a spectacular room packed with Christmas presents, Christmas ornaments, and a Christmas tree. All unique in the fact that they were all composed of the same colours; black and silver. It was beautiful. It was breathtaking. It was simply astounding to be in the room.        I have a memory of being in that room, long, long ago, possibly even prior to my birth into this world. I remember being in the room and playing with many other children there, all of whom were equally astounded to be there. After playing for a while in this room the adults there began to give away Christmas presents to all of the children. I received my FIRST Christmas present there. I watched, as the other children opened their boxes and they received all kinds of toys, exquisite clothing and other gifts that were extraordinary to be sure, but I chose to wait till the end of the presentations to get my box towards the last. At my turn to receive a gift, what I found inside my box was a small floating glowing crystal.  The adults there asked me if I wanted it. I remember looking at it with intense curiosity. It shone brightly in silver, and then would fade to black- but even then when it was completely black, you could still discern that it was a beautiful crystal. Then after awhile it would lighten, it would become black for a while and then it would become somewhat silver, and then fade back some then again silver and then again black. Sometimes completely black and sometimes brightly silver. Some of the other children had received this type of crystal, as well, in their first Christmas presents. All of the crystals were similar, but each shone and faded at different intervals and for different periods of time. I examined some of the other lucky childrens crystals, some shone brightly silver most of the time, others would shine and then fade at regular intervals, others were erratic- shining and fading at seemingly random intervals. All were beautiful and all looked extremely fragile. All of the other kids who had not received a crystal were jealous of what the lucky children had received. It was like they had not passed some type of a test of character and they were not yet ready for this type of a gift. Again, the adults there in the room with me expressed some doubt, and asked me if I wanted my present? Again I looked and compared my crystal with what the other lucky children had, my crystal with this second look seemed somehow defective. My crystal had long periods where it would be completely dark, several periods where it would be between dark and light, and very short periods where it would shine brighter than any of the other crystals. Then it occurred to me that this wasnt a defective crystal at all, but in fact, a unique crystal that was completely different from any of the others that I had seen.

This time, now, that I was in the room, everything was the same except there were no other children here. I was equally astounded to be in this meticulously decorated room and yet, I had a sense that I didnt want any of it. That it was just a memory from long ago, and that having matured to middle age- I didnt want any of it anymore. It was like the passing of a stage. How many of the other children had settled for the shiny wrappers and the electric thrills, ornamental clothing and toys, and I, like a few other lucky ones, had waited till the last and received the most precious gift of all- a life, and now I didnt want mine anymore!  And from here I felt I had passed a stage into another room up above the room I had been in.

(I\xe2\x80\x99d known I was gay for about a year, but\xe2\x80\x94happily\xe2\x80\x94the process of chasing girls wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really any different from what most of my friends were doing to chase boys.)

Suspended, just for an instant, above the sofas and chairs and paintings, I knew everything was going to be OK, and that nothing earthly was really very important in itself, due to the planet\xe2\x80\x99s position as a world within a larger world. A minute or two later, I tuned back in to the minister\xe2\x80\x99s talk, and he was on the last category of the sower\xe2\x80\x99s seed, that which fell on the good soil and yielded a hundredfold crop.

1020,DEE,1319,51,,F,"I awoke at 2:00 a.m. and noticed a dim light that appeared to be emanating from the wall in the hallway. I thought that was odd, as all the lights in our apartment were turned off and my husband was asleep in the living room. I sat up in bed to get a closer look when I saw two images very clearly displayed on the hallway wall, which appeared in the center of that dim light. They were two shadows, one in the shape of a butterfly and one in the shape of a dove. They were quite detailed. The butterfly, for example, had the veins in its wings prominently outlined as if it were made of stained glass- but it was a shadow, in black and white. The dove also appeared to resemble an image you might see on stained glass, only black and white. I sat up further and spoke out loud to myself: I am awake. This is real. What I am seeing is real... Then, the butterflys wings began to move and it flew up the wall and to the ceiling, where it disappeared. Next, the doves wings began to flutter, and it also moved up toward the ceiling and disappeared. I had the intense impression that this was a sign that I had moved in a positive spiritual direction that day, by having that talk earlier with my husband in which I opened up about myself.

All of a sudden I felt myself come out of my body and in a flash, my spirit, or whatever you want to call it, was out of my body, across the room, in front of the television. I saw the television and then I was just there, right in front of it. It was still on but I cant recall what was showing at the time this happened, I just know it was on and I could see it. I remember feeling this amazing sense of freedom and that I could go anywhere I wanted, as quickly as I wanted. I looked at the hotel room door and thought to myself, I want to go out there, see how far I can go like this. It was a very very pleasant and unbelievably exciting feeling, but I was also scared.  In that instant while I was looking at the door thinking about going further, reveling in this sense of freedom, speed and excitement, I suddenly I heard a voice (it wasnt a voice like we speak in the literal world, it was a voice that I could identify as male, I think, but instead of speaking out loud, it was like a knowledge in my head. Its hard to convey this correctly) saying If you want this to stop, you have to wake up now. I heard it and was still looking at the door. The voice/knowledge again said Sally, if you want this to stop you have to wake up NOW! with heavy heavy emphasis on the word NOW.  This time I listened and the next thing I knew, I was back in my body, sitting up and sucking in a HUGE gulp of air as if I hadnt taken a breath in a very long time, the same way you would if you were holding your breath under water for as long as you could stand and then surfaced. I was so scared of what I had just experienced I ran to the min-refrigerator, grabbed one of the beers from the six pack i had bought earlier, along with my cigarettes, and went outside where I drank the entire beer and smoked probably 4 cigarettes in a row.

I felt infused with the concept of a Son of God (Jesus). I saw many levels of overlapping consciousness on earth. I understood my necessary place in the universe through specific visions of relatives/loved ones. I absolutely believed in a God that is love and ultimate reality, who has a hand in everything we do.

1032,ME ,1406,55,,M,"  In 1954 I was born in Astoria Queens, NYC and brought up in the Diocese of Brooklyn. I attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel School and Church. My family moved to Northern New Jersey and I finished my Catholic School in Immaculate Conception in Franklin NJ Diocese of Patterson. To my parents credit one can see where the foundation of my Catholic Faith was formed. I was dragged to church. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there so eventually when I was old enough I left. I lived a very sinful life. One can only imagine where I was but I was not with God. I joined the Navy and began to become an adult and my world did not include God. Things happened to me that in retrospect God must have chose me for better things because my Guardian Angle was very busy.  I met Protestants, while in the Navy. These people were FIRED UP FOR THE LORD. They were obnoxious thumping their Bibles. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them. Finally in 1975 I associated with them enough that in Key West Baptist Church I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. The evil one still had a hold on me and I soon returned to my secular and sinful way of life. As we headed east for Desert Storm in 1990 there were definately more Christians than I have ever seen on an Aircraft Carrier before in my life. History is what it is with that war. Prayer works. Never doubt it.   I did get married to Paula in 1982 in St. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s Church in Sussex NJ. We had a good life as a Navy couple. We attended Mass sometimes mostly non-denominational services. For some reason I developed an attitude toward the Catholic Church.  I retired from the Navy in 1999 and by 2003 we found ourselves in Warrenton VA attending the Warrenton Presbyterian Church. Make no mistake the Pastor and congregation of Warrenton Presbyterian are blessed people. I had attended a Methodist Church for a couple of years, while living in NY so going to church now in my life became a necessary event. But I still was not dedicated to it. I had a Protestant perspective on forgiveness, which is what the Bible says happens if we repent; That is what I was taught by Protestants, however it still is not the teaching of the Catholic Church.  Life was good life was bad. I had some financial difficulties with other obstacles in life and I earnestly prayed to God that he help me get my life in order. Paula and I by the grace of Divine Providence found St. John the Evangelist church in Warrenton VA about 2006. It reminded us of our old time Catholic up bringing and we both felt like re returned home. We stayed.   Now in 2012 at age 57 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to back track. At age 54 or 55 I attended Mass during Easter. Father Cozy discussed the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Saint Faustina. I thought it was interesting that all one had to do was say this chaplet for salvation. Fr. Cozy had planted one of the larger mustard seeds of faith in me, no doubt. As a government contractor my customer was the Navy. I was able to walk the walk and talk the talk with Sailors so I excelled at my job (at least I thought I did). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I was age 55 that I bought my copy of St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary. I had to ride two large deck helicopter and aircraft carriers in a month\xe2\x80\x99s time so my travel to west coast gave me plenty of time to read the diary. I read through St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary like a novel. I eventually realized this was a 20th Century Saint talking directly to me. She was talking directly to me! Through Providence I started saying one Hail Mary a day also eventually this lead up to a full Rosary. I guess the door with no doorknob on my heart was being opened to Jesus. Things started to happen. While on one of the ships I shared a stateroom with two Harrier Pilots. They were both Catholic and noticed what I was reading. We shared some fellowship. I finished the Diary and it was like there was a bonus CD in the back of the book. The bonus was St. Faustina stayed with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say apparition in this essay, but I will say \xe2\x80\x9cheightened spiritual awareness.\xe2\x80\x9d I had this sense Sister was with me. I attended my first Divine Mercy Service that Easter and completed the novena prior to that. I was able to venerate and kiss a first class relic of St. Faustina during the service a woman had and shared with us all. It was about this time in May that I was coming home form work. I pulled in my driveway and was gathering my wits when in my interior voice. The interior voice! In my interior voice from nowhere I heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice say thank you. The voice was so beautiful and melodic. It could only be associated with Our Blessed Mother. I paused and took it in. Hopefully I said a prayer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember but I probably did.

1035,OBE,1238,34,,F,"Thank you very much for creating a space for these stories. I am very excited to tell mine. I am an artist and at the time I was transitioning from sculpture to painting. This extraordinary experience happened about thirty years ago.   One afternoon, before leaving for work, I decided to do a short meditation. I sat down on a carpet in my living room and assumed a meditation position. Moments after I closed my eyes, a clear blue window-like space appeared on the left side of the horizon. My conscious self became molecular, like a blip, or a tigle and I moved at the speed of light through the space. I first saw the edge of a sea. Beautiful sand edged the pristine waters which were gently rolling on to the shore. The area was completely clear of any vegetation or trees. I then found myself in the air, looking down at circular homes which were in a row. They were reminiscent of yurts or hogans. Then quick as a flash, I was inside, looking at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s back. She was tall, dressed in a black robe with crystals around her head. Telepathically I knew that she was a Priestess, a Healer. The Priestess was standing before an altar of some kind. Next, a small room emanating magenta light came into view. The room was translucent; the walls, ceiling, and floor emanated this gorgeous magenta light. Another room stood beside it, emanating a beautiful clear green light. Instantly I understood that these were healing rooms and that this civilization used color for healing and balancing the body.   I found myself outside, watching women and children playing on a hill. It was a bright sunny day and the children were laughing and chatting. On the hilltop there was a white stone post and lintel with three square colors atop the lintel. The colors were tints of the primary colors of red, yellow and blue. Every now and then a boy would run under the post and lintel to stand for a few moments. Then he would zip out to play again. I understood that this structure helped boys balance their chakra energy; it helped their energy flow without hindrance. Only the boys needed it; it was not necessary for the girls to do this.   Lastly, I found myself looking at the back of an old woman who was sitting on a bench. She was contemplating an exterior mosaic or mural that covered a long low wall. I approached this very colorful abstract wall. Soft sounds emanated from it as the colors moved and fused into each other. I knew that my gross ears could not hear the extraordinary beauty of the music that was created by the fusing colors. The wall was alive, changing into different configurations of beauty, much like a kaleidoscope. The old woman had created this beautiful wall and it was she who was responsible for bringing the concept of color healing into this civilization.      I re-entered my body with a great jerk and my eyes opened. I got up from my spot on the floor and went to work in a daze. There is no way for me to put into words how life changing this event has been. Seeing this beautiful world allowed me to understand the power and healing properties of color and sound. I continue to make art that will bring beauty and healing forces into our world.

1041,OBE,1521,43,,F,"I had a two part experience with this series. I had an OBE with the first and fourth meditation. In the first meditation I experienced a dropping down into my heart. Once that happened, I felt myself leave my physical body. I found myself in the rings of Saturn. I observed this area for a bit. I could feel something like wind and could hear the planet rotating. I watched as rocky material went by. I say watched, but it wasnt like watching with your eyes. I felt like I was going in a circular motion and felt like I was standing, but not really standing. I shifted my consciousness to look down because I felt like I had moved from the rings to somewhere else. I found my consciousness in the middle of the DNA helix. It seems like I stayed there for quite awhile and could feel a sense of awe. I felt in awe throughout this whole experience. I then found myself sort of floating in what felt and looked like darkness, but not scary darkness more like space darkness. I became aware of a shape, but it was on a mammoth scale. There is nothing that I can even compare it to. It felt like God, OM, greatness. I was then in the middle of what seemed like what would be comparable to the bloodstream. I was moving very fast and saw lots of red around me. This shifted from the bloodstream to the galaxies, other planets, humans, animals, trees, everything. I felt like I was being shown that everything is connected and on an even larger scale, we make (everything) actually makes up God/OM. We are the heart, everything is about the heart. In the 4th mediation I had a similar, but different experience. I dropped down into my heart again, but I stayed there for a bit. I had the sensation that I was laying on my left side. I could hear a muffled heart beat. Not a perfect beat and it sounded as if it may even be skipping beats, but so comforting. I became aware of the feeling of warm fluid all around me and inside my nose, lungs, mouth. I could see my right hand, but it was very tiny and very pink. It was mostly dark, but a little bit of white light was around the edges of this space. I felt as if this was me and I was in my mothers womb. I remember feeling the most comforted I ever have. It was so comforting, but also very confining, but not in a bad way. From there, I felt like I was in a white light spiral. The spiral shot the purest white light through my heart and out of the crown of my head-simultaneously. My consciousness catapulted out of my chest, but also through my head. Up, straight up and fast, but completely enveloped with white light and love. I felt like there were beings that were moving with me, supporting me, but they had no physical characteristics. They were pure light.    ",,American,"25,000",spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,never,very strong,littl,"0 24,999",High,Yoga st,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult
1042,OBE,1373,39,,F,"I copy here the experience exactly as I typed it then. This records my third experience. The first one occurred in February of 1984 and then August, 1984. The third one in January of 1985, as written.  Jan.26, 1985--it has happened again (On what I experienced in early morning, only half awake). There was a rushing sound, a roaring in my ears. I am half awake now, with consciousness of my surroundings, and also have the feeling I am about to plunge off a cliff, a falling sensation. I feel, just briefly, a sense of immovability--the way in a dream one tries to move and cant, and also a sense of fear arises at this. Then the images begin, the feeling one of plunging deep into a vortex, but everything is vividly clear, in color. The images are against a black background, and they are perfect crystalline forms, changing constantly, that make me think of snowflake forms at times, then of those theoretical models of chemical components or DNA, and then of pure rock crystal forms. The speed of the images is way beyond me, their transformations occurring without cessation. Nothing exists but this silent world I seem to have entered, as the forms recede and accelerate alternately in the darkness. Then they stop--disappear, and what I see at a vast distance in total blackness, as if I were looking through a telescope backwards, only infinitely smaller than that, is a tiny circle of light. I see it as if I am looking into a cauldron of light, barely glimpsed at such a distance, but it shifts and flickers on the edges. Only a tiny part of it is revealed to me, but the light is so clear it is like the interior of a diamond--a dazzling light, that oddly conveys a sense, for which I cannot account, that it has a knowledge of some sort--as if the light was source. Then a tingling feeling occurs and the image ends--it all goes away, and I sense my regular surroundings again. I try to go to sleep. The first time this happened, last February 84, I was scared silly.  The images occurred after I experienced the same roaring sound, but at that time (also an early hour, between 2 and 5 a.m.) there was also a loud cracking sound; in fact, that happened first. The images were, then, not immediately visible. They appeared finally in the center of a deep blackness at a great distance in a curling, churning fire of light, and accelerated toward me until I could see the swirling changing crystal forms. I stayed up an hour afterwards, writing it down. I felt then the same tingling sensation at the onset and end of the event, and the same moment of immovability. The second time (all told, it has happened three times) was last summer, August, 84. And now this one, around 4:30 or 5 a.m. The fear was briefer; I knew more of what to expect, and it was as if I willed myself to hold on. I had been asleep, wake up to the buzzing, electric sensation, and the rest, and then it begins. I let the images come. In the times between the 3 events Ive tried to make it happen, unsuccessfully. Each time has occurred only spontaneously. Each time I feel I have encountered something with great energy or power within it. I feel it will happen again--that there is more to learn. Especially within that light. It frightens me, yet I sense it has meaning, validity. I wonder at its meaning, and seek it out.

1052,DEE,1261,24,,F,"Earlier in the evening, I was very lonely as my new husband was gone a lot. I had only been married about 6 months, and I was beginning to realize that perhaps I had made a mistake marrying this man...that he wasnt all that in love with me. A few days earlier, I had said a prayer and asked if this was all there was to marriage and asked for help from God even though I want sure if there really was a God.  A few days later, I was asleep next to my husband. And I felt like I was having a dream with this bright light appearing. It was the brightest light I had ever seen...almost a piercing blue white light. I opened my eyes and realized this was not a dream at all! I looked into my closest where the doors were open and out of the left back side of the closest, the light radiated from. I wasnt scared...actually it was quite comforting. I quickly woke my husband up. He couldnt believe what he was seeing either. I kept saying, what is it? Is this real or are we imaging it. We both just sat there for about a minute staring at the light. Again, it was the brightest light I had ever seen but, the light didnt radiate throughout the room but stayed concentrated in the closest. After it disappeared, I just continued to sit up in bed trying to figure out what had just happened. Then, out of the blue, I began speaking in a language that I had never heard. My husband heard me, and thought I was going crazy. I had no idea what was happening. It wasnt scary....just really weird. This continued non stop for about 3 hours until I was completely exhausted and went to sleep at about 6am that am. When I woke up, I was completely perplexed as to what just happened to me. I decided I needed to go talk to someone about this so I went and visited with my priest at the Episcopal church at the time. He tried to explain it but, I was still perplexed as I had never heard of speaking I tongues, nor had I asked to have that given to me.

1063,SDE,1278,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true.

It seemed both immediate and eternal, at the same time. I didnt pay much attention to the potential consequences, at the time of the accident. It wasnt until I meditated on the experience that I felt the full potential of what had happened and what could have happened. I could have been killed. At the time, it was just a minor accident. But, it wasnt, really. I am very thankful to be able to tell this story. As I recount it, part of me takes the results for granted-(foolish human). It was Divine intervention, I have no doubt. I learned, again, not to take God and Guru for granted. I owe my life to the Divine in more ways than I can conceive. I am grateful, Graceful.

1069,DEE,1490,48,,F,"Then, I saw a door that opened very slightly. Through that gap of the door I saw the light, such bright wonderful light behind the door. The light spoke to me but did not use words. I wrapped me up in a feeling of love and acceptance. It told me without words that I should not fear, not be afraid, that I was loved and accepted and forgiven. I so much wanted to see more of that light, to see more, but the light told me without words that if the gap would just open more, it would be too much for a human being. It made me understand that we humans cannot grasp the full meaning of the light, not in our human condition, but that we would become ONE with the light when our time comes and there would be joy and love.

1073,ADC,1514,40,,F,"I was sleeping with my 9 year old son, Connor. My brother, Tripp, came to wake me up to tell me that my step-mother had called to tell him my father had passed away. I believe the time was 2:36 a.m. or close to that. When Tripp whispered to my from the hallway, I immediately jolted awake. I knew why he was waking me. He told me that he was going to my dads house, but that I should not go. I went downstairs to tell my husband that my dad had passed. Looking back, I was very calm. I was not crying or upset. My dad and I had an extremely close relationship. I was wide awake, so it was not that I wasnt fully understanding, I just wasnt upset for some reason. I went back upstairs and quietly got back in bed so as not to wake up my son. As soon as I lay back down, I fell back to sleep with no problem at all. (Another thing that seems strange given the situation.) It seems as soon as I feel asleep, I wasnt really sleep anymore, but sitting on my couch at my own home in Savannah. I looked up from my couch down the hall to my front door. Our front door has glass panes in it. Through the panes, I could see my dad standing there. He looked young like he did when I was a little girl. He had on seersucker pants, a starched white shirt and a bright yellow tie. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I slowly walked to the door. Time seemed to go very slowly. He was patiently waiting and just smiling at me through the glass, his eyes never leaving mine. As I made my way to the door, I knew that he shouldnt be there. I also wondered how I got from the bed at my brothers house to my house in Savannah. I knew that he was gone and should not be here on earth. As I opened the door, he smiled, and said, Hey there, Sweet Girl...I promised you I would come back to see you in Savannah. I just stood there for what seemed like a long time and then slowly walked to him and started to hug him, but then I remembered the pain it caused when I hugged him because of the tumors in his abdomen. But he sensed my hesitation, and said, It is OK Sweet Girl. You cant hurt me anymore. There is no more pain. Then he walked through the front door, into my foyer and straight up my staircase where he just kind of vanished...I stood and watched him walk away, then I just immediately woke up, and I was wide awake, and the dream was as real and vivid as if I had just been standing at my front door. I was not groggy at all or scared or sad. I was so happy and comforted that he had come to me. I could still feel our hug. I looked at the clock and less than 40 minutes had passed since my brother had come in to tell me that my dad had passed away. I lay there for over an hour replaying the dream. Then as I was falling asleep, I begged and begged him to come back.

1079,NDE,1398,32,,F,"I remember a feeling of being sucked out of my body, sort of like separating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with all the stickiness and resistance. After I was completely separated I was observing from above as they were performing CPR and attaining IV access. The doctor put my body in Trudelenburg position. At this point, my attention is drawn away by a feeling that someone was calling me. My attention became focused on this sparkling light, I want to call it a warm glowing light but it is hard to describe because the physical sensation of warmth was not really present. As soon as I acknowledged this light, I was just in it. There were these rainbow orbs that spoke to me and there were people there in what I was communicated to be a sort of holding room. I didnt see anything other than people and orbs in this room that went on for what seemed like an eternity without walls or ceiling. Soon after, I remember laughing but not laughing like in a physical sense, but, in any case, laughing with the people in the room. It was like I ran into old friends and we just picked right back where we left off type of feeling. I dont really have a sense of time of how long I was there but I was guided to another location and there was a woman there who said that I was going to be experiencing what I termed a rewrite. This is so hard to put into words but she communicated to me that a different course was available to me if I so chose to follow it. I felt like everything was more real than anything I had ever experienced, so alive, so intelligent, so revealed. The woman was near a mountain, at the base of it in a vivacious green meadow. We sat for a while but I cannot put into words the things I learned, I dont even remember what I had learned until I come across events in my life that trigger the knowledge that was given to me. I know it sounds strange but it makes sense to me. I was given a choice. You can stay or you can go back. I remember asking questions, like, go back where? And as soon as I asked that question, I knew where. I dont think the complete question even came forth before the answer was already being revealed. This is when I could hear conversations going on. I could hear the people in my ICU room. Complete conversations. I became saddened and wanted to see but I was informed that I had to choose first. I heard my son crying, begging me to open my eyes. My attention went to the woman, her eyes were crystal clear pale blue eyes and she had long dark hair, dressed in a sort of plain creamy colored garb. She never spoke sound words, it was telepathic thoughts. She revealed different life traumas I had experienced up to that point; I was wondering why only the traumas and not the good times, and just as I had that thought the answer was that it serves a purpose and that purpose comes to me at different times since my near death. I also heard my mothers prayers and the prayers of others pleading for my health and wellness. I recall leaving the woman in the field and I just seemed to float away...into space...and it felt as if though I had rushed millions maybe even billions of miles away in seconds. I seen these other worlds and other peoples only to be drawn back in a flash to the holding room. It was time for me to decide and it seemed urgent; will I accept the rewrite or stay where I was; there was no right or wrong choice. Only my choice. I longed for my children, knowing that things would be very different in a bad way if I chose to stay. I was communicated that my road to recovery would be hard at first, but would get easier as time went by. It was hard for me to conceive how this time would be if I returned. I felt drawn back and chose to go back all the while knowing it was going to be difficult. As soon as I made the choice, the people in the holding room became ecstatic and exuberant and I thought this was the strangest occurrence of the whole ordeal. I all of a sudden felt the most unbearable discomfort, my body. I tried to open my eyes and couldnt, I felt the loudness of my heart beating at an unthinkable speed, I immediately came back out of my body and hovered over it for a moment before entering again. The next thing I remember is the nurses and doctor in the ICU room asking me to stay calm because I was connected to a ventilator. My hands were secured to restraints. I couldnt focus my eyes when I first came back, I had been in a coma for 9 days. I had apparently became septic after surgery and went into septic shock. On entering the ICU on July 1, 2002, I slipped into a coma, they intubated me, and there I lay dying until July 9th, my daughters birthday.

1080,OBE,1477,53,,M,"Lets take a trip......this is not any trip, this is my trip and it happened the night or second night home from the hospital. I began traveling through a darkness. It is BLACK! no stars, no planets, no lights, NOTHING! Void. A black hole I dont know what else to call it. Except in a very, very, very far distance is a very small gold and I mean GOLD light flickering like a candle or generator running off cycle or something. I began to get closer and closer. The GOLD light grew larger and larger and closer and closer. As I got close enough I could tell what looked like a snow globe or very lucent clear crystal ball and this GOLD light was inside this globe. As I got closer I could tell inside this globe were what looked like stars. Sort of looking into the sky from earth. But inside this globe these stars were very bright or a crystal or bright white. It is nothing I have ever seen before or can compare to it. There were no bright and dim stars, they were all the same. In this middle was this Golf glowing light. I did not go inside this and was kept at a distance hanging out in this blackness. On the way all I could feel is a state of AWE! no words, just a beyond any middle boggling experience anyone could have imagined. On this travel it was like your mind is wondering out there and focused on this GOLD light thinking what is going on?. Getting closer to this globe I noticed I began getting messages or bits of information or something that seem to be sending these messages to me. These messages begin telling me some things I need to work on. Which I did not understand at all. I am beginning to get a better understanding each day since. There were many messages or I guess even judgements that I received in which stated I did or just point out or something (still processing) but three Primary things I need to do before I am to enter or go to or inside this globe.

1084,DEE,1399,51,,M,"I could hear people speaking who were around me, was well aware of my surroundings--I did not expect this visitation to happen. I had said a little prayer (just in case) asking for forgiveness for those I had directly or indirectly hurt, and waited to die--so I thought. I wondered what it would feel like; i.e., would the lights just go out, would it be painful, or what. I could not tell the sex of my visitor, it appeared to clothed in a lovely robe-like material, was very human in appearance, had a lovely smile, appeared gentle and loving and I could see through it. What surprised me most is that it spoke to me without words. The thoughts just jumped into my mind. It knew what I wanted to know just as I had the thought develop in my mind, and I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d Looking back on the experience, that thought makes me smile every time I think about it--it really happened that way. The message was that of love, that it did not matter whether I lived or died--I would be cared for. Finally, the overriding message was, LOVE WAS ALL THAT MATTERED and I did not need to worry. The visitor stayed with me for some time (several minutes) and when I turned to look away, out the cabin window, I could see the lights of a city below. When I turned back, my visitor was gone. In a way, this proved how real the visitation was. It was NO dream. After the plane landed, I was met by an ambulance and taken to Daniel Freeman Hospital. Thinking that I had a Mexican GI upset I was taken to a ward treating GI problems, a nurse noticed that my blood pressure dropped to nearly zero, I was then rushed to a CC unit and placed under the care of a cardiologist, Dr. Ciralo (sp?). There I was diagnosed with severe cardiac dilatation and heart failure, it wasnt until later that a pheochromocytoma was discovered. I was severely hypertensive and apparently this was the cause of my heart failure. When my hypertensive condition was brought under control, my heart returned to normal. This was all documented by ultrasonography and angiography. The pheochromocytoma was removed from my abdomen 1 month later at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. I think back on the experience and still worry about the unknown, but listening to the audio tape of your book has helped restore my faith in the reality of my experience. Thank you!!

At one point during the night I had awoken again from the fever and at that time I became more aware that my illness was worse, much worse than my parents had originally thought. I definitely dont believe my parents were aware of just how ill I was because had they know they would have taken me to a doctor. At this point when I awoke from the fever I was delirious again and wanted to get up and wake my parents to tell them how sick I was but I didnt have the strength to get up or yell for them. I was very distressed by this time as I just intuitively knew I was very ill and I needed help, but was helpless as I could not speak let alone get up to tell my parents. Just as I thought my fever couldnt get any worse and as I laid helpless in my bed a white-golden light started to appear to my left and I turned my eyes to see this white-golden light begin to form against the wall. This white-golden light began to take shape until it became three separate beings, all bathed in the white-golden light they formed from, a white-golden light that seemed to dance all around them. They did not speak, they did not look directly at me, but instead they stood silently with heads bowed. I do remember they were all dressed in what I can only describe as a monks robe, with the hood and large sleeves. As soon as I saw the beings of light I immediately began to feel better, I no longer felt feverish, my aches stopped and my strength was coming back. Prior to that moment I was feeling the worse I had all night and my fever and delirium still had a grip on me, yet the moment I began to see the beings forming my fever dissipated and the delirium went away. Once the beings were fully formed my thinking was completely clear again, no delirium and my fever and aches were gone. The overwhelming feeling of complete serenity, peace and calm came over me, I was not afraid of the beings in the least and instinctively knew they were there for me, then just as suddenly as the golden beings of light had appeared they faded away.

1095,DEE,1528,38,,M,"I was leaning in the doorway smoking. listening to music on my I pod. I was in a very sombre mood (feeling sorry for myself) I remember asking for help. There was a line in the song I was listening to about opening my eyes I suddenly began to notice my posture as slouched but I was being drawn up to standing straight, my shoulders were being drawn back and my head back. I just felt a huge power running through me, drawing me up (im quite tall but my head was now pressing against the upper doorframe) I felt strong for the first time in months , like I was being lifted up. my head was being tilted back and upward to the sky. I could see (or more accurately sense) eyes and a smile in the dark rain clouds in front of me. I can remember being aware (it was also in the song I was listening to) that I should open my eyes. All the while this was going on I had this huge energy holding me bolt upright urging me to look at the sky, I can remember feeling so peaceful yet so powerful at the same time. it felt like I was being lifted up. The face in the cloud faded and I literally fell to my knees in thanks (dropping my cigarette) I started to feel fear and this was instantly taken away by what I describe as a divine sense of humor, that told me not to worry about the cigarette getting wet and that it was funny that I had dropped it.(laughing with me not at me) I got up (after some time) and was just full of adrenaline I was shaking but happy.

1096,ADC,1394,49,,F,"Terry Dean                         1946-2012 Terry was a well-known and dedicated musician in the Overberg and Hermanus. Terry\xe2\x80\x99s battle with cancer started in 2007-where it was diagnosed in the colon. He was successfully operated on in September that year and recovered, remaining healthy until March 2009, when a tumour was removed from his small intestine. He received chemotherapy at Tygerberg Hospital afterwards and seemed well. He continued to play his gigs-he said the music took his mind away from the pain. His last gig was just after New Year 2012 at the Shuntin\xe2\x80\x99 Shed in Bot River-but he was very weak by then.  The last six months of his life, he was cared for at home-with the help of Hospice. Terry slipped into a coma on Thursday 28th June-I spoke to him and told him it was alright to move on, that his daughters T&#232;gan and Tullia, and I, would be fine. I also asked him to send me a sign when he crossed over. He passed away in the early hours of Friday morning. He was smiling. I knew he had left us, and in the early winter morning, I looked out of the window up at the grey sky-completely overcast except for a very defined sliver of blue sky- in the perfect shape of an electric guitar. I was so grateful for that sign. Terry had asked a good friend of his to sell his beloved Fender Telecaster (which he bought in America) to help support his family-as he had been unable to work for months. I was told that the lady who bought it was called Tracy; and she had bought it for her partner, John, whom we had never met, as they live near Johannesburg. The morning of Terry\xe2\x80\x99s passing; I received a call from Tracy, enquiring how Terry was. I told her that he had passed away in the early hours of that morning. She gave me condolences and put John on the phone. This is what he told me: On the night in question, at about 11:45 p.m. my very faithful dog, Sasha, nudged me with her nose and would not stop...until I got out of bed. I was at my farm, not far from Hartebeespoort Dam at the time. Only to find Sasha sitting next to the Fender case... I made a cup of coffee, called my dog to the kitchen and she would not budge. I know that it sounds weird, but, I had to play the telecaster... my dog left the room as soon as I plugged the guitar into the amp... played a few bars of John Lee Hooker and went to bed. As you know I phoned you the next morning to offer my condolences... how I knew that?... your Terry was with me, of that I am sure... I feel that he has been back, too often I find myself compelled to play the tele. Bear in mind, I have seven other guitars, all very good... but the tele keeps calling...??? The guitar is well and safe... I play the smoke out of it and love the mood it leaves me with... I am sure you understand what I mean by that. In any case, I have no opinion on the life here after, but, Terry Dean was with me and wanted to hear me play, to see if I was up to scratch, I think?

1103,DEE,1420,15,,M,"On the third day in the hospital, the day I had planned to end my life, I spent the only night of my treatment without a roommate. In hindsight, however, I know that I was not alone that evening. During a period of intense reflection, I decided to open the Bible that was provided in each room. I casually flipped through the pages and eventually turned to the back cover where someone had scribbled a few of their favorite verses, one of which was Ecclesiastes 7:17. I immediately located chapter 7 / verse 17 in the very top right corner of the page, next to the page number of 717, where the number 717 was scratched in pen directly above the page number. I was strangely comforted and terrified simultaneously as I read the words, \xe2\x80\x9cBe not over much wicked; neither be thou foolish. Why shouldest thou die before thy time.\xe2\x80\x9d The rest of the chapter proceeds to advise the reader against submitting to the extremes of both righteousness and wickness, foolishness and wisdom, and purity and profane. Ill always have a physical monument of this miraculous affirmation of Gods love for me because, like the heathen I am, I took advantage of my lone solitary evening in the hospitial to secretly remove the passage which I carry on my person to this day.  Though I did not realize it until ten years after the fact, this was a covenent with God that was initiated before I ever even entered the hospital. Shortly before I plotted my suicide and entered the hospital, I had carved a cross into my chest and filled it with black ink as I selfishly pleaded with God to end my girlfriends unintended pregnancy. At the age of fifteen, my shortsighted naivity deluded my judgment into thinking this child would mark the end of my existence. Shortly thereafter, my girlfriend miscarried an innocent life whose destiny was not its own. I had desperately pleaded with God to change the course of my life and received more than I bargained for when, to my surprise, our covenent was sealed during that third evening in that hospital. The undoubted reason that God used the trifect appearance of 717 to get my attention is because 717 indicates the month and day of my birth on July 17, 1987. It was through this miracle that God sealed our first covenant with the symbol of 717. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a wealth of revelations that have continued to unfold through the present day.

My father had died of a glioblastoma at age 54 in 1978. I prayed with concern over my sisters initial test results and began to cry uncontrollably. Very suddenly, I began to feel an exceptionally warm energy burning beneath my stomach but above my abdomen. This warm energy began slowly traveling up through the center of my body. By the time it entered my head, I had received knowledge that my sisters test results would turn out to show a benign condition. I cant describe how I knew this, but I was 100% certain that that would be the outcome and I had received this knowledge from some knowing entity.

He was standing on 3 legs with one of his front legs in the air a position Ive never seen a cat take. In addition, he seemed to be in a trance. When I called his name, he could not hear me. His head was moving slowly from side to side, left to right, like he was transfixed by some image. I looked in the direction of his gaze and saw nothing but darkness. He stayed in this position with these movements for several minutes in a trance-like state.

When I turned to move forward again I could see in the distance what appeared to be the end of the tunnel. It was made up of a beige inflatable cushion-type structure. I quickly moved forward to reach the end. I was greeted by an elder angelic-like spirit who began asking me questions almost to verify my identity. I answered them, but after a while, I questioned why I needed to answer all these questions. After that, the being stepped to the right and before me I saw a bright blue sky with perfectly shaped green trees, which had leaves rustling by a gentle breeze, though I could not feel the breeze.

From my left appeared my deceased father, as he would have been at about 35 years old dressed all in white \xe2\x80\x93 a short-sleeved white tee shirt and white cotton-type pants. He had been 54 when he died. He seemed to communicate telepathically to me but I responded using physical speech. He initially asked me how I was. We turned in the direction of the rolling hills again and this time I saw many people all dressed in white silently walking in the right direction. I did not know these people or where they were going. He suggested we sit at a concrete garden table to the left with 2 concrete benches on either side. Beyond the table I noticed a one-story concrete building with no windows or doors that I could see. My father wanted to know how I was and said he was concerned about me. At the time, I was undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer (DCIS ductal carcinoma in situ, stage 0). I reassured him there was no need for concern as the radiation wasnt bothering me at all and the DCIS was not ever fatal. He told me he was very proud of me. After a time, He asked me to come around the table to where he was sitting so I could give him a hug goodbye. As I did, he asked me to forgive him. The encounter was pleasant up to that point. When he asked me to forgive him, all my memories of how he had been a strict disciplinarian came back to me and I started to feel badly, reliving those feelings I had as a child and teenager.

One day while checking for a water leak outside on December 13th, I noticed my rosebushes were in bloom. I immediately thought of Sister and what is she up too now. I called and was told she died. I clipped the roses and gave one to each of my family and put the rest in a bag for her niece. I didnt know how many there were so I dropped off the bag. 5 siblings and 5 roses. I know in my heart of hearts the roses were a sign of her giving me a heads up on her passing. We were very close. She died a month before.

Now, it is important to know that I had NEVER studied anything about India or its culture up to this point, even though I have always cooked with their spices, been attracted to their clothing, and always felt drawn to learning Ayurveda.  On the map of India, it drew me to an area called Gujarat (again, I had never heard of this place, but when I googled it, it was exactly where I was shown on the map). Making things more interesting, one of my spirit guides is named Ajwa, and there are streets and parks in Gujarat named Ajwa.  The next thing I knew, I was mentally whisked to a beautiful area, and to a house where I lived with my mother and father. At first it was nice and peaceful and I felt at home. I was female and in brightly colored clothes that I loved. I remember the area was so green and lush. My mother and father there were my brother and wife in this life. This was the mid 1800s, and the British military were there.  They came in the night and took my mother away to rape and kill her. I remember the panic I felt knowing I would never see her again. What is really interesting is that prior to this event, I was always terrified of my wife getting kidnapped and killed. Since this event, I have no fear because I know it is left over from India. Anyway, the English soldiers came back the next day and burned our village. I was raped and my nipples cut off. I remember being held down in one of the buildings, like a stable, as others looked on.

1134,DEE,1300,23,,M,"My fathers office was divided into two spaces--a 2nd floor front office where he worked (with large windows overlooking the street below and surrounded by several multi-story apartment buildings), and the back office--a large bright kitchen/lounge area (illuminated by skylights)--connected to the front via a private 20 foot corridor. As soon as I arrived and handed my father the story, I felt that same strange feeling in my heart like I had felt a year earlier--the feeling that compelled me to pray. Not wishing a repeat of what happened a year earlier (see my other DEE entry)--I excused myself, telling my father I would wait in the back lounge while he read. My father wasnt spiritual or religious, and I was embarrassed that I suddenly felt a strange urge to pray. I entered the back lounge, and shut the door. I then got down on my knees and bowed y head to the floor for the first time in my life. And I suddenly started to weep. Like, uncontrollably sob. And words came out of my mouth that werent words from conscious intention. I was baffled to hear myself speaking the words. Why are we so bad? Why are we so bad? You have to understand,I didnt have a bad bone in my body. I was kind, and sensitive, and yet, these words were flowing from my mouth. And I felt such deep deep shame. Moments later, however, I felt a hand press down on the small of my back. I tried to left my head up to see who was there, but like my hands suck together in the previous DEE, this time my whole body was stuck to the floor. Quite literally, I was pinned there and couldnt move. Before I had a chance to be afraid, however, I suddenly felt two firm hands grasp my head, lift it off the floor, and turn it to the right. And there, beside me, was a fully manifested Celestial Being, kneeling on the floor beside me and looking compassionately into my eyes. As I previously wrote, my family wasnt religious, and I had no knowledge of religion at all. However, I immediately knew this Celestial Being was Jesus like I had known him my whole life. He was bearded, and wearing simple robes. (I no longer remember the color of the robes or the color of his eyes--I was too astonished that he was there in the room with me.) His eyes were mesmerizing--I was literally transfixed by his gaze. Where I had been sobbing moments earlier, and feeling deep shame, I suddenly felt the most incredible all-encompassing feeling of unconditional love. I wasnt scared. I was in bliss. And there wasnt anything I needed to ask. I felt as if I knew everything, as if I was everything, as if I was the Love itself. And a message was transmitted to me with this Love. You are loved. You are forgiven. You are respected. You are accepted. You are special and you are important. You are cared for, and everything is perfect. All of this transpired in a matter of seconds, and then Jesus bowed his head to the floor and prayed. And the hands that had moved my head to see Jesus, turned my head back to the floor, and continued to hold me there. The next thing I remember, my father opened the door and asked me if I was okay. No, I said. Im pinned to the floor. Please call Mom. While my father went back to the front office (there was no phone in the lounge), my experience suddenly changed dramatically. I was suddenly hearing sounds that were loud and clear and very real, but very distressing. The sounds were of emergency sirens, gunfire, and women shrieking in terror. At the same time, in my minds eye, I could see the major urban intersection near my fathers office with windows all blown out, burned out shells of cars in the street, and snipers scurrying in the shadows. I thought I was being shown a vision of the end of the world, but when I asked if that is what this was, there were no answers. Moments later, my father returned, and I found that I was able to get up off the floor. My mother was on the phone and wanted to speak with me, so I headed to the front office. However, as soon as I walked into the office and saw the large picture windows, I was immediately stricken with the most intense paranoia. I collapsed to the floor, certain that I was going to get shot by a sniper (probably connected to the frightening vision I had moments earlier). Long story not as long, this paranoia lasted another half hour or so during which time my father managed to get me into his car and drive me to his house (my old family house where the previously reported DEE took place). Once I got home, and was under the care of my mother, the paranoia dissipated. However, it transformed into a mania that lasted for another 40 hours or so, during which time I believed I knew everything about everything, wrote many things about God and life, and couldnt sleep. Finally, after about 40 hours, I crashed and slept for 16 hours.

1138,DEE,1319,51,,F,"I awoke at 2:00 a.m. and noticed a dim light that appeared to be emanating from the wall in the hallway. I thought that was odd, as all the lights in our apartment were turned off and my husband was asleep in the living room. I sat up in bed to get a closer look when I saw two images very clearly displayed on the hallway wall, which appeared in the center of that dim light. They were two shadows, one in the shape of a butterfly and one in the shape of a dove. They were quite detailed. The butterfly, for example, had the veins in its wings prominently outlined as if it were made of stained glass- but it was a shadow, in black and white. The dove also appeared to resemble an image you might see on stained glass, only black and white. I sat up further and spoke out loud to myself: I am awake. This is real. What I am seeing is real... Then, the butterflys wings began to move and it flew up the wall and to the ceiling, where it disappeared. Next, the doves wings began to flutter, and it also moved up toward the ceiling and disappeared. I had the intense impression that this was a sign that I had moved in a positive spiritual direction that day, by having that talk earlier with my husband in which I opened up about myself.

1144,NDE,1276,45,,M,"My first memories was a sense of unnatural sounds like the building itself was breathing or living somehow. I saw through the walls to a room that I knew was on another dimension or in a spiritual plane. In this room, men sat and leaned against the walls while they waited. I knew somehow that they were waiting to escort the dead to another place. I knew that I was close to death in this moment and that was the reason I could see them. I was not afraid. I just knew it.  My next memory was of a village setting that looked medieval or European. The streets were cobble stone and the buildings were stone as well. People walked in groups down the road. I think a better description would be that they wondered aimlessly. They looked straight ahead, slightly downward and seemed to be without hope. I had an overwhelming feeling of gloom in this place and I felt as though they were being punished or detained in some way.  The thing that was MOST striking about these visions was there absolute vividness. It was as though I was seeing them with the most high definition TV ever seen. I could not explain how powerful this sense of visual clarity was. It was as though it were more real than real life. Even though these people seemed as though they were not supposed to look at me, occasionally one would lock eyes with me for just a moment. They had such despair in their eyes that it saddened me to make eye contact.  Later I was in this same place in a large arena, though that is not really the right word. It was a place in a large building that had a circular path that came in one door and passed in front of what seemed to be stadium type seating.  I had a feeling that people were paraded through this place in the lines I had seen them walking in on the streets to possibly be judged or reviewed in some way. Again, the architecture was like nothing I have seen here in the states. It seemed very old and mostly made from stone.  My next and final memory was my defining moment where I was like a speck dust floating in a space that felt like a large room. I was exactly like those particles of dust that you see floating randomly in the open space of a room as the sunlight passes through a window. I was free, floating on an invisible river of air through this space, around a tree or plant, feeling sheer joy and amazement. I had no identity in these moments. I had no memory of anything personal or earthly. I only knew that I was truly at peace. I was one with the universe, completely accepted, and loved. I felt such joy in those brief moments that it makes my heart race even now as I recall it. As I passed through this space, I saw a very obvious ray of what I thought was sunshine coming downward from the right from no obvious window or light source. I didnt question anything, but I remember a sense of really hoping that I would drift through this light. As I did enter the light, I felt happiness like I have never known. I felt as though anything I had known before this moment was infantile and insignificant. I knew this was the presence of God, though I did not see a face. I dont even know that I had the ability to look at the source of the light. I just basked in its glory.  I saw flashes or arcs of light zipping above me. They looked like just that really, but I felt like they were something bigger than me, something more than I could even try to understand. Later, I remembered seeing a phenomenon called flying rods that I have seen myself in videos that I have where these things that are not visible to the naked eye show up on high speed video and they appear to swim through the sky with multiple wings on a straight translucent body.  I wonder if these could be what I saw in this place. As far as I know this phenomenon is not explained scientifically yet, but you can find hundreds or thousands of video accounts on youtube by searching for flying rods. I may be nothing, but then again...  I had a number of very substantial things that became known to me in this place. For one, the reason that everyone describes these visions as being so vivid is that we are not looking at them with our failing human eyes. We are seeing them in a supernatural state of being where our tired old eyeballs could not even begin to compare. Also, I became acutely aware that I am a being inside of a being. I felt that I am a spirit aside from the conscious brain thought, which I always thought was ME. Suddenly, I had all of these memories of things like driving on long trips when I am complete zoned out in deep thought, yet somehow my body is driving the car, slowing and speeding up in traffic, using turn signals, and yet I arrive 30 miles later not remembering the drive.

I got a flash of him falling to his death from a tower and some pages of strange script.

As I held him and prayed I became keenly aware of this dark presence following quickly behind my son and me. This awareness was not in real time but still, an intense awareness of this strong force. I began having chills and intestinal disturbances and felt true terror. As I felt this force nearing both of us and about to encircle us. I was very aware that this force was actually the dark angel of death. My prayer changed from please God, allow my son to live to God, if you have to take him then he is your child not mine. And I am aware that I am your child as well and you will have to help me. At that precise moment I felt a shift in my sons breathing.

And then this incredible awareness occurred and my thought was oh my God, its God. And in that moment I becamse aware that God was/is more real than anything else that I had ever seen or known. My perception of God changed in that instance from my being a skeptic to the assurance that God is a definite and known entity. It was as real as anything that I have ever seen. I felt bathed in this glow and felt warmed....held and loved. Im not sure how long this lasted but slowly the light rescended but the awareness did not. The feeling that I had was the peace that surpasses all understanding. I knew that my son was going to be fine. My chills disappeared and I felt no more worry or anxiety. The doctors continued to check on my son and finally an hour after the light appeared they came in and said we think that hes turned the corner. I felt like they sure got the news on a delayed schedule. For a long time I felt that I was having some stress response to my sons health crisis but the knowing has never receded. Ive ever since referred to this as my near death experience by proxy. My son improved and was released from the hospital several days later. That event still is vivid and real in my mind like it happened yesterday. The awareness and belief from that experience has continued on to this day.

1158,DEE,1182,4,,F,"It was night and I was in bed. I dont recall this part well, but somehow I became aware that my father was not at home. (I was somewhere between 3-5 years old) My father had gone to visit a neighbor two doors down (old Mr Safran) I was a timid child and for some reason I was utterly scared of this neighbor, even though there was no reason to be. He actually was a kindly old gentleman who even remembered the neighborhood children in his will but for whatever reason I was very frightened of him. When I awoke and realized it was (to me at least) late at night and my father was not yet home, I was terrified that Mr Safran had hurt him or killed him. (Again, no reason why I would think this) I was laying in my bed and I was terrified. I dont remember if I was crying, but if I was, it wasnt loud enough for my mother to hear. I was (and still am) the type of person that does not cry out for help. I dont know if I was praying for my father to be ok as I dont remember if I was old enough to have been taught about free-form prayers. Anyway, I felt a warm, comforting, loving presence that assured me everything would be OK. (And of course it was, as my father had never been in any danger whatsoever other than in my mind) It was like being wrapped up in a warm soft blanket of love and happiness.

1159,ME ,1067,33,,F,"I prayed for probably 3 4 months, as I continued to read the Course and do the workbook. Suddenly, literally out of the blue, one day I had an encounter with my boss where I felt blamed for something that wasnt my fault. He said something to me, and I responded in a really defensive way. The moment I spoke my response to him, I felt the left side of my scalp tingle. Not just a tiny tingle, but the ENTIRE left side of my scalp really tingled like the way you might imagine it feels when a cats hair stands on end. During this encounter with my boss, I was fully aware something strange had happened on my scalp...but I was too wrapped up in the defensive discussion to really pay that much attention to it. Later on the same day, I had a negative thought about something else, and this very strong tingle thing happened again. Very shortly, I realized what seemed to be happening was that my prayer had been answered...I was being shown without question, which of my thoughts had a negative component to them by having this very strong tingle each and every time I had one! This amazed me, and still does to this day. For the next several months, I got used to this feeling and played around with it. It happens without fail, when I have any thought that violates Gods (or our own) nature. If my thought is really big, the tingle is really big and covers the entire left side of my head. If my thought is smaller, a passing thing, the tingle will still be there...only reduced to a tiny tingle on mostly the top of the left side of my head. As I worked with this feeling, I learned very quickly how to avoid the types of thoughts that would make the tingle happen. At this time, I rarely have the tingle...ie: I have trained my thought process to be much more loving. The tingle is still there very strongly if I slip up, however. I can also make the tingle happen on purpose, simply by deliberately thinking about a very negative or hateful emotion. I thought this was interesting in that it is something I can do at will, as well as it being there to warn me off bad thoughts when I havent been trying.

1162,OBE,1133,39,,M,"The night before I had this experience was a very emotional point in my life, the world seemed so terribly unjust and cruel that I was at a breaking point, that evening when arriving home walking from my car to the front door I paused to look up into the star filled sky with tears rolling down my cheeks quietly cried Why, why, why? I could not understand how the complete innocents of this world could be treated so terribly, how children could suffer so unjustly under the hand of others. I cried to sky as the universe because I could not believe in a God and had little faith in anything spiritual, if any.  Since rejecting the belief in God at the age of about 22, I did not believe such a thing could exist, because any such God which would allow these kinds of things to happen wasnt any kind of God to me. I couldnt pray to the concept of God but the universe was real, the immense out there, the all that is was something I could pour out my heart to without needing a belief in God. That night I gave the heavens my full heart seeking an answer to that question, with all my heart tearfully pleading for the answer. The next afternoon I received an answer to that question; since we are all a part of one another we do it to ourselves.  Although the answer didnt completely make up for all of the pain, much of the edge of that pain was taken off by finally being able to understand why such terrible things could happen to others in our world, to simply understand we have the freedom of choice to do such things because in the wider perspective the reality is we are all one and in that hurting no one else other than ourselves. Because of this and this alone we are allowed the freedom to do good or evil, if we werent really one I do not believe the spiritual heart of life would allow such to occur, call that center God, the conscious collective, the collective soul or what ever name you might choose. I finally came to understand, in the end we all pay the price for any wrong as well as reap the reward for any good and this took away much of the anger I had against reality for allowing terrible things to happen to good people.  The following is how the answer came to me through a dream-vision which was the most lucid moment of my life before or since but I must also add the following; the experience and my conclusions from it are my own made from who I am as a individual and how I saw the experience. Was it really God on high I met? I thought it was but beyond my own belief I cannot say it was, perhaps I met a collective soul which was so wonderful to me I thought it was God when in fact God might be levels above, so to speak,.   The Vision: Meeting a Sun-Intelligence-God. Sun of Souls~Souls of Sun; One Spirit~One Life.  Note: This experience was no doubt individually viewed through my own shade of colored glasses, limited to my own ability to understand things at the time, how I needed to be shown who we really are. This may have been brought on by severe apnea, a problem I had where I could stop breathing for long periods of time. I believe I may have stopped breathing for far too long that afternoon and had come close to death producing this NDE-like experience. I dont really know if this was a OOBE or due to apnea, but either way, what ever caused the experience it deeply impacted my outlook on life, what and who we really are.  One warm afternoon in 1996 I took a short nap and unexpectedly awoke within my slumber to find myself in a vast void in the presence of a huge sun or sphere of light, quickly coming to the understanding that this sun was pure conscious awareness. I was completely surprised to find myself so fully conscious in this empty but light-filled void which I knew to be more real than waking reality, in this place feeling super-conscious beyond anything I had experienced before. Although the light was without any kind of visual hint of facial features, I strongly sensed it smiling nothing but love for me and through those feelings knowing an unseen face.  While in the presence of this light I immediately and fully felt it peering deeply into my own awareness, lovingly knowing everything about me all at once. Feeling such love coming from this light I suddenly came to an awareness that this sun was God! I was so overwhelmed and surprised that God was real that I mentally gasped and then yelled out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Real!\xe2\x80\x9d. Just prior to this experience I had a deep mistrust of religion and rejected the concept of any kind of God or creator, much less the idea there was any continuation for human beings beyond our physical lives. Years before this experience, I had decided for many seemingly valid reasons that religion and God were only a product of the human mind, yet there I was standing in the presence of what I knew without a doubt wa",,USA    Q.,"25,000",agnostic,atheist,Christian,Christian,,,dail,never,very strong,littl,"50,000 99",Did not,Satelli,,marri,single,Yes,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

I remember thinking that it was ok if they wanted to sit in the dark but that I wanted to go toward the light. As I opened the door I was surrounded by the brightest light I have every seen, so bright that it would normally cause one to close their eyes. It was the most warm, most loving, most peaceful experience- words cannot describe it. At the same time I realized I could see all around me, that I was not a body standing in the light but I was one with the light. I had no face, no eyes, no body. I dont know how long I was there.

1166,ADC,1290,62,,F,"On January 4, 2007, I was alone in the kitchen of my home in Ossining, NY. My husband was upstairs working. I like my home orderly and keep everything in its place. It was daytime and I was preparing some food when my eye caught an object by the floor. I looked down and saw a little white square paper wedged up against the dark green backsplash runner by the floor. I picked up the paper. It was actually an empty little envelope with a gold lining inside. The envelope looked like it was opened after it was sealed because it had a rip in the flap. It was the kind of gift envelope that contained a card with someones name on it that youd give with a gift at Christmas. On the front of the envelope was the hand-printed word Dad. It looked like my handwriting but I didnt remember giving my father this envelope in the 2 1/2 years we were communicating just before his passing, and we didnt talk to each other for 29 years previously. In my home, a random and obscure object just doesnt turn up mysteriously in a strange place like that. I stood there with a shocked feeling, staring at the envelope. I thought I knew it came from a spiritual source but I wasnt ready to accept that. I had to rule out all possibilities. I called for Hank to come down and showed him the envelope. I asked if it was his. He said no. I asked if he ever saw this before. No. Could he imagine where it came from? No. I asked if it fell out of the newspapers he recycles in the kitchen. He said no. I told him where I found it and that it came from Holy Spirit. Hank became agitated and got a little angry. He was annoyed that mysterious, spiritual things like this were happening to me and darted back upstairs to his office. I stood there looking at the envelope and asked out loud: Dad, are you here with me now? Suddenly, a brisk wind came across my bare shins and I felt the chills. Then I knew my father was with me. I wanted to know more about this mystery, so I called a cousin of Hanks who was a Deacon at a Catholic Church in New Orleans. I asked Gary what all this meant. He said that God made my father my Guardian Angel and that my father would be watching over me. This was awesome. Although I had had a love/hate relationship with my father, I just loved him now and was happy to know he was with me. I have fond, loving memories bonding with my father in my childhood and enjoying life with him. (Im uploading a photo of this envelope.

He told me that he was going to my dads house, but that I should not go. I went downstairs to tell my husband that my dad had passed. Looking back, I was very calm. I was not crying or upset. My dad and I had an extremely close relationship. I was wide awake, so it was not that I wasnt fully understanding, I just wasnt upset for some reason. I went back upstairs and quietly got back in bed so as not to wake up my son. As soon as I lay back down, I fell back to sleep with no problem at all. (Another thing that seems strange given the situation.) It seems as soon as I feel asleep, I wasnt really sleep anymore, but sitting on my couch at my own home in Savannah. I looked up from my couch down the hall to my front door. Our front door has glass panes in it. Through the panes, I could see my dad standing there. He looked young like he did when I was a little girl. He had on seersucker pants, a starched white shirt and a bright yellow tie. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I slowly walked to the door. Time seemed to go very slowly. He was patiently waiting and just smiling at me through the glass, his eyes never leaving mine. As I made my way to the door, I knew that he shouldnt be there. I also wondered how I got from the bed at my brothers house to my house in Savannah. I knew that he was gone and should not be here on earth. As I opened the door, he smiled, and said, Hey there, Sweet Girl...I promised you I would come back to see you in Savannah. I just stood there for what seemed like a long time and then slowly walked to him and started to hug him, but then I remembered the pain it caused when I hugged him because of the tumors in his abdomen. But he sensed my hesitation, and said, It is OK Sweet Girl. You cant hurt me anymore. There is no more pain. Then he walked through the front door, into my foyer and straight up my staircase where he just kind of vanished...I stood and watched him walk away, then I just immediately woke up, and I was wide awake, and the dream was as real and vivid as if I had just been standing at my front door. I was not groggy at all or scared or sad. I was so happy and comforted that he had come to me. I could still feel our hug. I looked at the clock and less than 40 minutes had passed since my brother had come in to tell me that my dad had passed away. I lay there for over an hour replaying the dream.

I saw the laundry all full. I gave Mum a big kiss and she was happy to see me and have me visit. Each room was perfect right down to the wood grain on the cupboard doors and wardrobes. It was clearer than I can even remember now. I could touch and feel everything. I said can I look in the huts and I did opening the door and checking both out. The smell was the same lol. They were full of junk And I said to Mum how come and she said we keep all the extra gear in there because us kids arnt there. When I was inside the house if I concentrated real hard I could almost see the burnt walls and floors like a shadow or silhouette but Mum said to me firmly with a serious look on her face that she is NOT going to allow me to see that and it vanished. She said that our home exists in two different places at once. Its like one place is on 92fm and her place is 102fm. They share the same place or space but out of tune so u dont see the other. Anyway we had visitors come and go with cups of tea. Dad arrived in from up the farm smiling and whistling. You arrived for a visit and chat also happy and smiling. Everything coming and going as I thought of them. When I was in Mums old bedroom with the built in mirror I tried to look at myself but when I did I was like a ghost. Very faint and just a shape. And yet I could see the bloody grain in the varnished doors right beside. We went to the A&amp;P show and there were not many people there but it was on. What happens is only the people you knew and think about come through. This explains how in the spirit world its not jammed packed with every person who has passed on just your loved ones and friends coming and going like real life. Ok back home again and Muns really young and beautiful probably in her twenties. See they can appear as any age they want. I knew it was mum. I swung her around then she fell over a chair laughing. I had tea with Mum and now the afternoon was getting darker it was time for me to go. I have her a big hug and began to cry with joy. I knew I was experiencing a dream but it was much too real for just a memory and I could ask questions. I thought I would wake Sue with my crying but I went back to Mum. She smiled and said she is happy and well and not to fear. I asked her if I could come and visit her again but she got serious again and said no but she will think about it. I said how about once a week and I begged her but she smiled and said maybe. Oh well I thought. I walked out the gate and some guys standing on the driveway who looked like Eddie yates. He was wearing a parka and there was a farm implement behind him. I said to him who are you ? and he told me his name. Random spirits appear too and he was out the gate and seemed to be waiting for Dad to come out to see him. I hopped into my car yes u can drive in the afterlife but its cool . You dont have miles of boring nothingness. Next second Im on my way home to Hokitika and I stop in a town. I got out at a park and some guys sitting there in his car with his mouth wide open looking at me. I said what are u looking at ? He says you are bloody flying and floating up in the air. I said so ... You can too come on up so he hops out and flies up to me. He was hopeless and tumbled over. I laughed. Then I awoke in bed at home with tears running down my cheeks and so bloody happy I had to wake Sue and relay this story. It was not a dream but was a real experience. It was like a near death experience without the death. I could see anything I wanted and ask questions at will. I feel a lot more content about home and Mum and I have been shown a glimpse of heaven. It was SOOO nice I can see why Mum is restricting my return. If u stay and dont go back you die and its not my time. But we are allowed to visit but only when our loved ones allow us.

I actually could not see these people they did not reveal themselves. I saw an outline like an aura white and thin foggy. Someone said to me telepathically come over. I hesitated scared I remember and said Im not ready. Then snap I was lying down again and opened my eyes. The room was exactly how I saw it through them closed other than the beings were gone. I felt like I knew these people intimately more than the people I know in this world even though I couldnt see them I sensed they were close to me like family like my real family. I felt I could trust them but that I hadnt completed my purposes on earth yet. I was in effect asking for more time.

1180,DEE,1420,15,,M,"On the third day in the hospital, the day I had planned to end my life, I spent the only night of my treatment without a roommate. In hindsight, however, I know that I was not alone that evening. During a period of intense reflection, I decided to open the Bible that was provided in each room. I casually flipped through the pages and eventually turned to the back cover where someone had scribbled a few of their favorite verses, one of which was Ecclesiastes 7:17. I immediately located chapter 7 / verse 17 in the very top right corner of the page, next to the page number of 717, where the number 717 was scratched in pen directly above the page number. I was strangely comforted and terrified simultaneously as I read the words, \xe2\x80\x9cBe not over much wicked; neither be thou foolish. Why shouldest thou die before thy time.\xe2\x80\x9d The rest of the chapter proceeds to advise the reader against submitting to the extremes of both righteousness and wickness, foolishness and wisdom, and purity and profane. Ill always have a physical monument of this miraculous affirmation of Gods love for me because, like the heathen I am, I took advantage of my lone solitary evening in the hospitial to secretly remove the passage which I carry on my person to this day.  Though I did not realize it until ten years after the fact, this was a covenent with God that was initiated before I ever even entered the hospital. Shortly before I plotted my suicide and entered the hospital, I had carved a cross into my chest and filled it with black ink as I selfishly pleaded with God to end my girlfriends unintended pregnancy. At the age of fifteen, my shortsighted naivity deluded my judgment into thinking this child would mark the end of my existence. Shortly thereafter, my girlfriend miscarried an innocent life whose destiny was not its own. I had desperately pleaded with God to change the course of my life and received more than I bargained for when, to my surprise, our covenent was sealed during that third evening in that hospital. The undoubted reason that God used the trifect appearance of 717 to get my attention is because 717 indicates the month and day of my birth on July 17, 1987. It was through this miracle that God sealed our first covenant with the symbol of 717. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a wealth of revelations that have continued to unfold through the present day.

1190,DEE,1158,9,,M,"As the night passed I would fall into and out of sleep, waking when I became cold with chills or hot from the fever. At one point during the night I had awoken again from the fever and at that time I became more aware that my illness was worse, much worse than my parents had originally thought. I definitely dont believe my parents were aware of just how ill I was because had they know they would have taken me to a doctor. At this point when I awoke from the fever I was delirious again and wanted to get up and wake my parents to tell them how sick I was but I didnt have the strength to get up or yell for them. I was very distressed by this time as I just intuitively knew I was very ill and I needed help, but was helpless as I could not speak let alone get up to tell my parents. Just as I thought my fever couldnt get any worse and as I laid helpless in my bed a white-golden light started to appear to my left and I turned my eyes to see this white-golden light begin to form against the wall. This white-golden light began to take shape until it became three separate beings, all bathed in the white-golden light they formed from, a white-golden light that seemed to dance all around them.

1196,DEE,1124,47,,M,"Testimony on God\xe2\x80\x99s Power As revealed to Conrad February 5, 2007, 6:25AM to 9:25AM Introduction My name is Conrad; I was born in the Philippines and was raised in a Roman Catholic family. I was an altar boy during my Catechism years. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the bible twice from cover to cover when I was young and every time I get to the crucifixion part, I cried. Some parts of the bible I would easily understand, but I also got confused in others. As I grew up a verse from the bible kept playing in my mind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which part of the bible it came from but it went like this \xe2\x80\x9cSeek ye first the Kingdom of God \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d and that is what I did. I went about seeking the Kingdom of God, read many books of different titles and pretty soon I discovered the wonders of Science and how it can reasonably explain things that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. The more science books I read the more convinced I was that things that were once mysterious can be scientifically explained and verified. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed in proving things undoubtedly before I believed it and accepted it. I only wanted to believe in known and proven facts.  And so I went through College and read even more books and gained more knowledge. I excelled in class but not good enough to have any honors because of my laziness and procrastination. You see, I would do well in exams, in fact I\xe2\x80\x99d be top in exams but not accomplish my homework or lab works so I also had grades that were just average. As my learning progressed I discovered that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need God to have a life or to live my life. I believed this with conviction and even had a theory that men created God and not the other way around. I wrote a thesis on how during the early stages of evolution men might have created God because there were many things they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand or were unable to explain. They attributed those things to an all knowing creator and consequently created a God. A friend of mine presented it as an English class project and almost got kicked out by the instructor. (That\xe2\x80\x99s how blasphemous it appeared but when you think deeper you can discern that men if left alone will instinctively seek God. We are the only creation that actively seek and try to understand our origins.) I went on with my life for years not believing or needing God until I got married to my wife Elisa in 1986 when we were both working in the Middle East. Our marriage did not give a child for almost five years. We went to see doctors and specialists in hospitals and clinics but we were unsuccessful. A surgery for me and standard medical procedures done for my wife did not result in conception. I desperately wanted a child and I would do anything to have one. I started wondering \xe2\x80\x9cAm I being punished for not believing in God?\xe2\x80\x9d Despite all these disappointments, we continued seeing fertility specialists. We also had Artificial Insemination in the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines. In December 1989, we went back to the Philippines for a much needed month long vacation. And one Sabbath day in January 1990, at the Manila Center (an SDA church in Manila, Philippines), a pastor from California was leading a service and he had a sermon about the earth being like a washing machine for dirty souls. He said \xe2\x80\x9cThe Earth is used by God to wash and clean souls to make them fit to go to heaven and live with God.\xe2\x80\x9d It opened my mind and I understood then why I needed God in my life. I wept and cried uncontrollably. It caught the Pastor\xe2\x80\x99s attention and I guess he pitied my poor soul so much that he gave me his Bible and even signed it. That night I prayed hard, a really sincere prayer to God and I asked Him to give me a child. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d I prayed \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a real God, and really powerful God, give me a child and I will convert to the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\xe2\x80\x9d Back to the UAE on February 1990, my wife tested positive for pregnancy and in November 29, 1990, our daughter Ari was born. I thought about my promise to God and the implications of that promise. My parents and siblings, my Catholic friends would hate me I thought, I would miss food that I grew accustomed to eating. I cringed at these possibilities and so I kept living my life the way I wanted and I justified my actions with some semi-scientific reasoning to deny God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing of a daughter for my wife and me. Fast forward to 2007, we have since moved to the US, we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in Boca Raton, Florida, New Orleans, LA and presently, The Woodlands, TX.

1203,ADC,1402,29,,F,"At the time, I described it as the most real and vivid dream I have ever had. In the dream, my deceased grandfather was communicating with me. He had passed away approximately ten years earlier and I had always said that I couldnt believe how much I missed him, even so many years after his death. This was my first loss and I took his death very hard because he had always been my father figure- my birth father had never been around (and died when I was 5), AND my relationship with my adoptive father was not close at all. Some specific details of the dream were not clear such as where we were or in what capacity my grandfather came to me, but I do remember that in the dream, I was very aware that it was impossible (in my understanding) for him to be there, communicating with me. My response in the dream was basically, How can this be, you are dead? I dont believe he said much to me, but I was so excited to have this time with him and I remember wanting to introduce him to my life since his death. I had no kids when he died and I wasnt married although I was dating my now husband. So, in the dream, I was feverishly trying to catch him up on all the events of my life...getting married, having two beautiful kids, going to university to become a teacher. I wanted him to be proud of me and I wanted so desperately to keep him around and involved in my life.  When I woke up, I truly felt that I had really lived this dream...a feeling I had never had with a dream and I remember wanting to cry because it was so real and vivid and now that I was awake, I couldnt get it back.  This has never happened again, and I always wondered if it was more than a dream.

1204,DEE,1297,67,,F,"Hank, my husband, and I were getting ready to move on December 10, 2012 from Ossining, New York to Milford, Connecticut. Most of the house was already packed up. I had gone through the whole coat closet downstairs by the front door, throwing stuff out and organizing what I wanted to pack up at that time or wait until moving day. There was a small shelf above the coat hangar bar that I looked over while standing on a stool to see what was up there and what needed to be thrown out. There were mostly gloves and hats which I kept there in case we needed them. We had just arrived home at night from eating out Thanksgiving Dinner on November 22, 2012. Hank hung up his coat first in the lit up coat closet. Then I took out a hangar, hung my coat on it and, while looking toward Hank and talking to him, I went to hang up my coat without looking at the bar or what I was doing because I knew that closet so well, after living in this house for 22 years. I had trouble getting the hangar hook to go over the bar. I tried and tried but the hook wouldnt go on the bar. It kept getting stuck on something. So I looked at the bar and saw there was a chain of some kind hanging down from the shelf above. There was a sliver of an opening between the slats of the wooden shelf and a chain had made its way through the opening and hung down in a loop, the narrow opening of which happened to be facing the tip of the hangar. So when I aimed, without looking, the tip of the hangar to go on the bar, it went through the narrow loop instead and got stuck there. I looked at the chain. I couldnt understand where this chain came from. I knew everything that was on the shelf and there was no chain. I pulled on the chain. It came down through the slat opening and a medallion of some kind followed it. I looked at this medallion with its long neck chain in the palm of my hand and just stared at it. I couldnt believe my eyes. That was my medallion and my chain that I had mysteriously lost 5 years previous. I had this piece of jewelry custom made for me, based on the image that I had seen when I was 29 years of age of a glow and cross. The medallion was a white Mother of Pearl flat, round disk (glow) with a MOP cross affixed onto the disk. When I received this gift to myself from the jeweler, I loved it and wore it every single day for about a year. One night Hank and I were going to a special place and I wanted to wear a special necklace that would conflict with the medallion and chain, so I took it off and probably placed it on my dresser in the bedroom, as I was planning to wear it again the next day. I either placed it on the top of my dresser or put it into my jewelry drawer in the dresser. The next day when I awoke, I looked for the medallion to put it on again and I couldnt find it. I looked on the dresser top, in all the drawers, on the floor around the dresser, in our bedroom, in the bathrooms and in all the rooms of my home, but Hank and I couldnt find it. It was missing for about 5 years and during those years, I kept on looking all over my house for the medallion, but with no luck. Then I thought that God was mad at me for taking it off, so It took it away. So, 5 years later, God had miraculously given back to me my medallion in such an incredible way. I showed it to Hank in disbelief. He was amazed how that medallion came back to me, and 5 years later! Then I told Hank that I had a bad thought, that It gave it back to me because something bad or hard was going to happen during or after our move and I would need this medallion that I loved so much and which connected me to God and Its serenity. Ive been wearing the medallion every day since and will wear it every single day always, even if it doesnt go with a fancy outfit. Our move was hard but Hank and I survived it and are doing well. Although we have to move again in a year and dont know where we will live, though we want to stay in Milford.

1206,DEE,1520,49,,M,"I had recently stopped drinking alcohol after 29 years of habitual and heavy drinking. My partner at the time was engaged in guided meditation and spiritual connection and growth. She convinced me to look to meditation and I discovered that I could use the pendulum quite successfully. I began to work very hard at the spiritual connection that I was forming. After a period of time i was able to hear messages and feel spiritual presence.I was shown the different spheres and told of the existence of other worlds and other dimensions. I had come to a point in my life where change was necessary. God had played a major part in my life until age 13....I felt divorced from him at age 49 and quite spiritually, emotionally and physically lost. In these early days of my transformation i was meditating and the room was flooded with a beautiful golden light. I felt myself being lifted from the chair....tears streamed down my face and the overwhelming message was to love God. From this point I began to understand that love was the key to change albeit with a great deal of hard personal work.

Everything was suffused with a gold light and in the room ahead I could see a body lying on a bier. My wife said, Look, youre dead. I said, No, Im just sleeping. There seemed to be no contradiction at the time to being the observer of my body in the other room. She said, Look at the people. Indeed, there were people walking by the bier and I could see by their faces they were there paying their last respects. It struck me then that I had indeed died. I was almost immediately filled with enormous pain, sorrow and regret. I had all kinds of things I still planned to do. If I were to die there were people I wanted to say goodbye to but the time had passed. I could not go back or speak to any of the people in the other room in any way they could understand. The pain and regret lasted perhaps 20 minutes (in dream time) and my companion waited patiently until I was ready to move on. During those 20 minutes all the prior things that had seemed so important just faded away. I was now on a new and different journey where nothing of my previous life was important or relevant any more. I was not ready to move on, but I awoke with all Id seen.

1208,DEE,1124,47,,M,"Testimony on God\xe2\x80\x99s Power As revealed to Conrad February 5, 2007, 6:25AM to 9:25AM Introduction My name is Conrad; I was born in the Philippines and was raised in a Roman Catholic family. I was an altar boy during my Catechism years. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the bible twice from cover to cover when I was young and every time I get to the crucifixion part, I cried. Some parts of the bible I would easily understand, but I also got confused in others. As I grew up a verse from the bible kept playing in my mind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which part of the bible it came from but it went like this \xe2\x80\x9cSeek ye first the Kingdom of God \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d and that is what I did. I went about seeking the Kingdom of God, read many books of different titles and pretty soon I discovered the wonders of Science and how it can reasonably explain things that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. The more science books I read the more convinced I was that things that were once mysterious can be scientifically explained and verified. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed in proving things undoubtedly before I believed it and accepted it. I only wanted to believe in known and proven facts.  And so I went through College and read even more books and gained more knowledge. I excelled in class but not good enough to have any honors because of my laziness and procrastination. You see, I would do well in exams, in fact I\xe2\x80\x99d be top in exams but not accomplish my homework or lab works so I also had grades that were just average. As my learning progressed I discovered that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need God to have a life or to live my life. I believed this with conviction and even had a theory that men created God and not the other way around. I wrote a thesis on how during the early stages of evolution men might have created God because there were many things they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand or were unable to explain. They attributed those things to an all knowing creator and consequently created a God. A friend of mine presented it as an English class project and almost got kicked out by the instructor. (That\xe2\x80\x99s how blasphemous it appeared but when you think deeper you can discern that men if left alone will instinctively seek God. We are the only creation that actively seek and try to understand our origins.) I went on with my life for years not believing or needing God until I got married to my wife Elisa in 1986 when we were both working in the Middle East. Our marriage did not give a child for almost five years. We went to see doctors and specialists in hospitals and clinics but we were unsuccessful. A surgery for me and standard medical procedures done for my wife did not result in conception. I desperately wanted a child and I would do anything to have one. I started wondering \xe2\x80\x9cAm I being punished for not believing in God?\xe2\x80\x9d Despite all these disappointments, we continued seeing fertility specialists. We also had Artificial Insemination in the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines. In December 1989, we went back to the Philippines for a much needed month long vacation. And one Sabbath day in January 1990, at the Manila Center (an SDA church in Manila, Philippines), a pastor from California was leading a service and he had a sermon about the earth being like a washing machine for dirty souls. He said \xe2\x80\x9cThe Earth is used by God to wash and clean souls to make them fit to go to heaven and live with God.\xe2\x80\x9d It opened my mind and I understood then why I needed God in my life. I wept and cried uncontrollably. It caught the Pastor\xe2\x80\x99s attention and I guess he pitied my poor soul so much that he gave me his Bible and even signed it. That night I prayed hard, a really sincere prayer to God and I asked Him to give me a child. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d I prayed \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a real God, and really powerful God, give me a child and I will convert to the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\xe2\x80\x9d Back to the UAE on February 1990, my wife tested positive for pregnancy and in November 29, 1990, our daughter Ari was born. I thought about my promise to God and the implications of that promise. My parents and siblings, my Catholic friends would hate me I thought, I would miss food that I grew accustomed to eating. I cringed at these possibilities and so I kept living my life the way I wanted and I justified my actions with some semi-scientific reasoning to deny God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing of a daughter for my wife and me. Fast forward to 2007, we have since moved to the US, we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in Boca Raton, Florida, New Orleans, LA and presently, The Woodlands, TX.

An unburned candle in the middle of a beach in September was highly unusual.

That size and shape candle is hard to find. The one I had at home was broken and I had looked to replace it for quite some time and never found one to match. I was speechless.

1230,NDE,1388,54,,M,"Bam!  That had to be a plane, I thought to myself. Nothing else could possibly be moving that fast. The force of the impact had snapped the drivers seat off and I felt the car being catapulted forward. That in itself was alarming.  I had been traveling north on I-75 just north of Atlanta, GA and had just been readying to exit the North Marietta Loop traveling at about 60 mph when the impact from behind had occurred. Just a couple minutes prior I had seen some jets taking off from Dobbins Air Base. It wasnt a plane that hit me though. It was an uninsured 19 yr old driving an unregistered vehicle. Witness reports put his speed at over a 100 mph as he wove in and out of traffic coming up I-75.  The impact caused the back end of my car to jerk out to the right. The wheels on my Toyata Corolla seemed to grab the road surface. I could feel the car begin to turn over. I knew how fast I was going. I knew the car would be turning over and over in a wild tumble. It was without a doubt one of those entire life in a flash moments. There wasnt a lot of time for any lengthy reminiscing though.  Just two thoughts went through my mind. The first was a pondering why Divine Spirit had chosen this time for me. Wow, I really thought Ive learned a lot in this life. Im just at the point in life where I might be able to offer others something worthwhile. Why now?  The second thought was expressed in a spirit of surrendering, God, I really only have one request. Id really like to take all that Ive learned with me to my next life. Please dont require me to learn everything all over again. Reincarnation is something that Im completely familiar and comfortable with.  The car began to flip over. I could hear the metal shearing and the glass shattering all around me. I felt the tumbling effect. I felt like I was inside a long tunnel like whirlpool. In the center of that incredibly fast spinning darkness I saw a bright white light, warm like the sun, very quiet and very serene.  Total silence.  I opened my eyes. Cool, I thought. I made it through this and Im not even hurt! No pain at all!  Then I tried to move. Not so much as a finger responded. I was lying face down, head in the back seat, my feet somewhere up around the area of the steering wheel. A thumb was pressing hard against my nose and lip. I could see that it appeared, by its relative positioning, to be the thumb from my left hand, but it was my right thumb. I could also see that my right arm bent in an awkward position under my throat. God, Im glad Im paralyzed because that would really hurt if I could feel it, I said to myself.  Totally paralyzed, I thought to myself. Quadriplegic. I will be a burden on everyone for the rest of my life.  I then concluded that because I was unable to feel any pain, that I probably had serious internal injuries as well. I would die here, but at least I would die without pain. I thanked Divine Spirit for that blessing.  I could literally feel myself, as Spirit, sinking slowly down and out of my body. It was a deeply sickening feeling. Then I heart a tapping sound. Are you all right? a womans trembling voice asked.  Im paralyzed. Call the police, call the ambulance. I said. At least I could talk, I thought to myself.  That started a flurry of activity. Over the next half hour, I heard sirens, people yelling and screaming, and the unmistakable sound of a helicopter. All the while I laid face down, head in the back seat, not moving. All the doors were jammed. The parameds were frantically trying to reach me and couldnt. They kept saying, Stay with us now, stay with us. They ended up cutting off the entire roof of the car and very carefully they lifted me out. I was placed on a stretcher, moved to level ground, and was immediately given an IV.  At least 5 or 6 medical personal surrounded me. The one directly above my face said to me, Mr., youre going to be all right. Then a womans voice said, Mr., have you made arrangements for organ transplants?  Yeah, I said. Its on my drivers license. I could see the guy directly above me stare down the lady who said it.  Then another voice spoke up. Mr, do you have a living will?  No, I said. I looked up at the guy above me and said, Im in it pretty deep, huh?  He smiled down at me and said Id be fine. Yeah, right, I thought to myself.  They strapped me in the lifeflight helicopter. Off I went to the Atlanta Medical Center Spinal Trauma Unit, the best such facility for hundreds of miles in all directions. Upon arriving I was placed in the operating room recovery room. Apparently there was more room there for all the medical personnel to gather round me.  After being taken for CAT Scans and an MRI I was returned to the recovery room. After the initial blur of activity, another seriously injured person was brought into the room. She was obviously near death. The doctors",,    Q.

1231,DEE,1300,23,,M,"My fathers office was divided into two spaces--a 2nd floor front office where he worked (with large windows overlooking the street below and surrounded by several multi-story apartment buildings), and the back office--a large bright kitchen/lounge area (illuminated by skylights)--connected to the front via a private 20 foot corridor. As soon as I arrived and handed my father the story, I felt that same strange feeling in my heart like I had felt a year earlier--the feeling that compelled me to pray. Not wishing a repeat of what happened a year earlier (see my other DEE entry)--I excused myself, telling my father I would wait in the back lounge while he read. My father wasnt spiritual or religious, and I was embarrassed that I suddenly felt a strange urge to pray. I entered the back lounge, and shut the door. I then got down on my knees and bowed y head to the floor for the first time in my life. And I suddenly started to weep. Like, uncontrollably sob. And words came out of my mouth that werent words from conscious intention. I was baffled to hear myself speaking the words. Why are we so bad? Why are we so bad? You have to understand,I didnt have a bad bone in my body. I was kind, and sensitive, and yet, these words were flowing from my mouth. And I felt such deep deep shame. Moments later, however, I felt a hand press down on the small of my back. I tried to left my head up to see who was there, but like my hands suck together in the previous DEE, this time my whole body was stuck to the floor. Quite literally, I was pinned there and couldnt move. Before I had a chance to be afraid, however, I suddenly felt two firm hands grasp my head, lift it off the floor, and turn it to the right. And there, beside me, was a fully manifested Celestial Being, kneeling on the floor beside me and looking compassionately into my eyes. As I previously wrote, my family wasnt religious, and I had no knowledge of religion at all. However, I immediately knew this Celestial Being was Jesus like I had known him my whole life. He was bearded, and wearing simple robes. (I no longer remember the color of the robes or the color of his eyes--I was too astonished that he was there in the room with me.) His eyes were mesmerizing--I was literally transfixed by his gaze. Where I had been sobbing moments earlier, and feeling deep shame, I suddenly felt the most incredible all-encompassing feeling of unconditional love. I wasnt scared. I was in bliss. And there wasnt anything I needed to ask. I felt as if I knew everything, as if I was everything, as if I was the Love itself. And a message was transmitted to me with this Love. You are loved. You are forgiven. You are respected. You are accepted. You are special and you are important. You are cared for, and everything is perfect. All of this transpired in a matter of seconds, and then Jesus bowed his head to the floor and prayed. And the hands that had moved my head to see Jesus, turned my head back to the floor, and continued to hold me there. The next thing I remember, my father opened the door and asked me if I was okay. No, I said. Im pinned to the floor. Please call Mom. While my father went back to the front office (there was no phone in the lounge), my experience suddenly changed dramatically. I was suddenly hearing sounds that were loud and clear and very real, but very distressing. The sounds were of emergency sirens, gunfire, and women shrieking in terror. At the same time, in my minds eye, I could see the major urban intersection near my fathers office with windows all blown out, burned out shells of cars in the street, and snipers scurrying in the shadows. I thought I was being shown a vision of the end of the world, but when I asked if that is what this was, there were no answers. Moments later, my father returned, and I found that I was able to get up off the floor. My mother was on the phone and wanted to speak with me, so I headed to the front office. However, as soon as I walked into the office and saw the large picture windows, I was immediately stricken with the most intense paranoia. I collapsed to the floor, certain that I was going to get shot by a sniper (probably connected to the frightening vision I had moments earlier). Long story not as long, this paranoia lasted another half hour or so during which time my father managed to get me into his car and drive me to his house (my old family house where the previously reported DEE took place). Once I got home, and was under the care of my mother, the paranoia dissipated. However, it transformed into a mania that lasted for another 40 hours or so, during which time I believed I knew everything about everything, wrote many things about God and life, and couldnt sleep. Finally, after about 40 hours, I crashed and slept for 16 hours.

Startled, yet at peace, looked up to see the deceased form of one of my fathers closest friends, a small town surgeon.

He smiled, and after standing there for what seemed an eternity, drew his hands from my back, stepped away slowly and faded before my eyes. I immediately arose and went to my desk. For two hours I sat motionless while I recounted vivid memories of the man who had helped a boy whose father was killed when I was eight years old.

1236,NDE,1098,37,,F," I started drifting off and could only vaguely hear them now.  I found myself floating down a long tunnel. I looked all around and was aware of a soft and mesmerizing light at the end. I wanted to rush towards it but found it hard to move forward and could do so only by forcing myself forward half swimming, half walking. Then, I heard a distant faint voice cry out \xe2\x80\x9cSinus rhythm collapsing, we are losing her\xe2\x80\x9d but I felt completely disinterested in this. Who was being lost? I did not know who they were talking about and was annoyed at the interruption. Now I only had eyes for the wonderful glowing light at the end of the tunnel which seemed to hold promise of great warmth and love unending. I felt so joyful and excited and all awareness of my body on the bed left me as I tried for some time to reach the light. I knew absolutely that wonderful things were awaiting, if I could only get to the end of the tunnel. The light now loomed larger and I could see faint outlines of figures waiting there, beckoning me forwards. I wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is waiting there, is it Sai Baba, angels or loved ones?\xe2\x80\x9d I tried harder and harder to reach the end of the tunnel.  Then, a very faint voice interrupted my travels with a tiny urgent \xe2\x80\x9cBaby on Board\xe2\x80\x9d and a pleading \xe2\x80\x9cBreathe! You must breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. (A nurse was apparently shouting loudly into my ear). This caught my attention. I stopped in the middle of the tunnel and wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho has a baby on board, who should be breathing?\xe2\x80\x9d And then thought \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is me, perhaps I am pregnant, if I am, then I must go back\xe2\x80\x9d and I turned reluctantly around. It was so hard to leave that wonderful promise of all-encompassing Love and Joy waiting in the Light and those light filled beings waiting there. The return down the tunnel was brutally sudden. I came back to consciousness to experience total chaos, doctors were shouting and my whole body was in pain. I felt icy cold, but I could see I was indeed pregnant. My memories flooded back and I knew I had many children and others who needed me to hold on. I fought to come back and although the heart rhythm was still unstable, immediately went into labour. Serious faced heart specialists told me \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t have the baby yet, we will deliver in two weeks when your heart has settled down\xe2\x80\x9d. I did not argue, I could see their point, but I knew from my previous eight deliveries that this labour was not a trial run. So exhausted, I steeled myself for a long night. Whether it was the right time or not, this baby was on its way. I was informed later that day, that I had flat lined for some time and that had this episode happened at our house, some one hours drive from the nearest hospital, both William and I would have died. I reflected on that urgent message in the morning, no wonder I had to get to hospital that day. How strange the many delays that had led to the nurse colliding with the heart specialist! I realized that I had been somehow protected all the way through this crisis. I also felt enormous gratitude for the nurse who had shouted in my ear, because I realized that I had only turned back because of her prompting as all knowledge of my present life had been wiped out. At dawn the following morning with labour well advanced, a grim faced team of Heart specialists and surgeons gathered to deliver the baby. I was hooked to a bank of heart monitors, and had needles in my feet, arms and hands. The recalcitrant heart was still racing and wobbling around. Their ominous expressions told me that they didnt give much for our chances under anaesthetic.   Would you like to leave any messages? I was asked. None, I replied. My husband and children knew I loved them, I told them that every day. Since seeing the two little boys standing together on that planet four years earlier in the OOBE, I felt sure that William at least, would survive to be with his brother. As the anesthetic took hold, I felt totally at peace, after all I had come close to the Light and it was so wonderful, I had no fear of death left. William was delivered with only minor difficulties apparently unharmed by his pre-natal adventure in the Star Trek ship!

1240,DEE,1542,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

Indeed, there were people walking by the bier and I could see by their faces they were there paying their last respects. It struck me then that I had indeed died.

1246,ADC,1185,45,,F,"To continue, after I went back to sleep, I had a dream which I consider an after death communication as it was very powerful to me anyway. In my dream, the brother of my loved one who died in May 2012 came to me in my dream. The brother of my loved one is also deceased and he died in 2003. In the dream it was just my loved ones brother and me. In the dream, I asked him, Wheres Bob? The brother said, What you want is overwhelming for him. We just looked at each other for a moment after that. In the dream, I felt a little confused. But I reached to hug my loved ones brother and said, Hugging you is like hugging Bob. Then we hugged and after that he dissapeared and the dream was over.  After I woke up, I remembered the dream very clearly. But, just like I was confused in the dream, I was confused when I first woke up. I thought to myself, What does he mean that what I want is overwhelming for Bob? Then I remembered that I had asked for the sign in the form of a particular song. I was stunned.  It was like my loved one sent his brother to tell me he couldnt give me that particular sign because it was too overwhelming. And to this day, though I have received many signs from my loved one, I never have heard this song playing anywhere! I guess it really is overwhelming! Anyway, it was so amazing to get that kind of answer so quickly. I truly feel I was having 2 way communication with the spirit of my loved ones brother.

1250,ME ,1270,29,,F,"In 1974 I was 29 years of age. (I am now 67 years of age.) I was feeling pretty despondent at that time, having spent four years trying to make a living as a visual fine artist in Manhattan but not succeeding. Not knowing how else to support myself, I enlisted in the Army. But as the day of my enlistment grew near, I was becoming increasingly anxious and fearful. I was a free spirit and knew I would hate losing my freedom and someone else telling me what to do. But if I didnt go, I didnt know how else to take care of myself. I did not want to go back to secretarial work, not after I fell in love with art. I was stuck in a tight spot.  Three days before the big day, I was sitting on my hotel bed. I had given up my apartment in Little Italy and took a room for 3 months in a midtown Manhattan hotel. I was just staring out into my room, not knowing which way to turn. It was daytime. With the suddenness of a light switch just turned on, a brilliant white, round glow with a more brilliant Christian cross embedded in the middle of the glow appeared before my eyes. The vision was suspended in mid air. The glow and cross were about ten inches tall and sat about eight feet in front of me, a little lower than my eye level. The light that emanated from the glow was contained. There werent any rays coming from it. The whole cross fit totally within the glow. The cross was a plain, elegant cross with no detail. The ends of the narrow vertical and horizontal bars were cut straight across. (This vision was entirely visual. I didnt feel, smell or hear anything.) Although the glow and cross were as intensely bright as a flame, I stared easily into it. I wasnt afraid by its presence or doubted what was before my eyes. I never said to myself, What is this? or Why is a Christian cross coming to me? I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish. Actually, my mind was blank, without any thoughts. But I was transfixed by this sight, spiritually locked into it. I was aware that the glow and cross were calming me down, making me feel peaceful and serene. I think I was staring at it for a short period of time, maybe 15 minutes.  I remember how the glow and cross came on but I dont remember how it went away. After staring at it, I think I put my head down on a pillow and went to sleep. But the strange thing is that when I awoke, not only wasnt the vision still there but I didnt even remember that I saw it. Actually, I didnt remember this event until 30 years later, when I was sitting in my car experiencing my epiphany, which I talked about in my February 23 submission to you. Looking back at that time, the glow and cross did not tell me if I should go into the Army or not. What this vision did was to calm me down, relax me and relieve me of a paralyzing anxiety which was keeping me from seeing clearly and making the right decision for myself. Relaxed and clear thinking, I made the easy decision to withdraw from my Army enlistment. I went to the Army base and explained how I felt. The female officer there agreed and gave me an honorable discharge.

He had this wonderful smile on his face and his being generated such great warmth. There were no words shared, but I could feel his love beyond measure for me. It was like our spirits were talking.

1253,ME ,1294,61,,F,"During the summer of 2006, Hank and I were at an outdoor party at a swim club in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. We had met this group of people the year before, so they were new to us. It was a sunny day and I was talking to a very suntanned man everyone called Mike the Painter, to distinguish him, I suppose, from all the other Mikes. While I was talking to Mike, his whole face suddenly turned a deathly gray color. It happened in a snap, as if you turned on a light and boom! I guess it was shocking to see because my brain took a couple of seconds before I realized that his face had changed to gray. His face was gray for several seconds and then it snapped back to his normal tan color. I stood there staring at him. I dont remember what he was saying. I do not drink or do drugs. After that happened and in the next day or two, I remember thinking about Mikes face and wondering if it did indeed turn gray. I couldnt believe I saw his whole face a gray color. I tried to disbelieve this experience had happened to me. I tried to deny that his face had turned gray. But every time I tried to deny it, I kept affirming that I did indeed see that Mikes face instantly turned gray, stayed gray for several seconds, then instantly turned back to tan. Since Im a visual person and a visual artist, I couldnt deny that I saw his face was gray because my mind sort of takes a picture of it and, also, I was able to call it up in my memory and I would see it again, so I couldnt really deny the gray color. I ended up believing that this happened, even if I didnt understand why it happened or why I saw it. A day or two later I understood what I saw and why I saw it. Mike was a heavy smoker. He was usually smoking a cigarette whenever I saw him. I believed that God wanted me to warn Mike to stop smoking or hell pass at a young age. I waited a whole year before I got up the courage to tell Mike. I didnt want this new group of friends to think I was a religious zealot or crazy. So that summer I went up to Mike and told him what I saw and that I was meant to pass this warning to him. I apologized if he thought I was a zealot but Mike stopped me and said he was Catholic and believed that people see signs from God. He said he wasnt going to stop smoking and thanked me for telling him. I saw Mike every summer for a few years after that time and noticed that he was still smoking. Hank and I have since changed our summer plans so I dont expect to see Mike at that location again.

I noticed his hands were at his heart, as if showing me he was in pain or had been in pain.

1257,ME ,1440,21,,F,"Dear Dr. Alexander, Thank you so much for your book, Proof of Heaven. I have not had a NDE, but I experience a variety of connections with/in my own body. I thought I would share them with you so that you might be able to incorporate these ideas and implications into the knowledge you now possess. Mini-bio: I am 32 years old, lesbian, a former college athlete, white, middle-class/U.S., non-religious. When I was in my teens, I was inexplicably drawn to spiritual books for the greater part of 2-3 years, and then that continued into college (previously, I detested reading anything). There was no explanation for this; I detested organized religion as well. I read books by Brian Weiss Many Lives, Many Masters; Charles Tart (actually flew to California to see him speak); Gary Schwartz, among many others. I found myself reading anything and everything I could find on reincarnation, psychics, NDEs, mystical ideas and the like. As I read more, it seemed like the reading experience was such that the more I read, the deeper I went into things I already knew...and that is what kept me reading. In part, I also think that I connected this knowledge with a more sociological knowledge of the body/spirit, particularly by way of sexuality since I was also, simultaneously, coming into the awakening of my sexuality and the relationship between aesthetic experience and physical sensation. For me, there was this immediate connection between sexuality and spirituality. At any rate, I went on in college to major in psychology, sociology, and religion/philosophy. I was one of the very few students in school that defended the reality of psi phenomenon, having never literally not really experienced it myself up to that point. I read the stories and just knew they were real. As I read more, and defended the idea more and more, I began to experience more in the way of expanded consciousness. All of this started shortly after this 2-3 year stint of reading. My clairvoyance is somehow limited by time; I know things are going to happen and Im informed of them, but only about 10 minutes prior. I receive information/images in the waking state in the form of symbolic interactions i.e. ideas are communicated by the meaning my psyche will construct if I cogitate about what very material relations actually mean or feel like specifically to me i.e. the particular is what carries the universal intent of the message/the lesson. In your terminology, I think that is my bodys way of adapting to the inflow of messages that it knows are from the outside. Most often, it goes like this: I will be receiving information that I can feel is information coming through and I will pay very close attention to the content because I know it is not just my own random thoughts (i.e. I would probably be a good receiver in telepathic studies). I will then obsess about what I can make of the structural relations of that content in the very context of my theoretical/sociological categories/knowledge...because it seems to me that it is in figuring out that puzzle that explains why it is that Im receiving that message. Sometimes I can figure out who it needs to reach. I guess this ties in with the quotation on your website that all thoughts and actions are interconnected...and that is true at every level. Story 2: Although it may have nothing or everything do with me, the night I was on my bed studying, crying, and mourning my deceased cousin who died the night prior she came to visit me by staging a physical impossibility... because she knew that would register to me (Im also a very scientific mind I see the possible by way of the impossible. My family makes fun of me for always asking for percentages and probabilities in all aspects of life). :) Anyway, the night prior to this, I remember the light bulb above my bed blowing out I could hear the filament hit the glass of the bulb. Nonetheless, I had left the light switch up/circuit open. As I was sitting there crying the second night, thinking about Beth, and feeling guilty that we had not connected more the year before when she requested that, the light illuminated in a fashion akin to those lights that very gradually get brighter/lighter by touch. It lasted for about 10 seconds. It illuminated in a way that is not possible given the type of light it is; it wasnt on a dimmer switch. And the visual was as if a blast of energy had simply traveled through the space. I know to a degree of 100% that this light bulb had totally and completely blown out the night prior. I was sitting in the exact same place. I immediately knew it was her, and was immediately brought to tears, again. I verbally thanked her. The next day I took the light bulb to a philosophy professor of mine who was very familiar with modern physics. He was a materialist.

1261,ME ,1302,51,,F,"Sometime in 1996, I was sitting alone in my office in my home in the middle of writing my memoir novel. I was sitting in my chair, thinking at the time. Suddenly I saw a vision in my head that Im entitling Our Human Timeline of Existence. It was a horizontally long image running left to right in my head. There were no words, numbers or sounds, only images. At the left of this horizontal Timeline was the first image. That image was of an ape down on all fours and facing left. To the right of that ape and facing right was a second ape starting to stand up. To the right of that ape and facing right was the third ape, looking Neanderthal. To the right of that ape was a picture of a human being facing right. Then there was a little space. To the right of the space was the image of Leonardo da Vinci\xe2\x80\x99s Vitruvian Man. To the right of that was a very, very long empty area. At the right end of the Timeline, the last image, is a great gust of horizontal wind blurring out the whole right end of the Timeline. That was what I saw. There were no dates on this Timeline. I thought about that vision and why I was seeing it. According to the spacing of the images one to another on the left and then the very long empty space in the middle area and then the wind blur all the way on the right, the vision said to me that, according to where Vitruvian Man was standing in the Timeline, we humans are currently (the 20th Century) into about 20% of our survival, from our beginnings on Earth to our end. I couldnt see our end because that was where the horizontal wind blur was, which took up all the space on the right side. There were no dates, so I dont know how it would happen to us, when, or if it would even happen at all. What I do see is that we humans have many, many more millenniums of survival. I believe I saw this vision and I believe (kinda) in what it was telling me. I wasnt sure what I was supposed to do with this knowledge except to tell people. But since that was one of my first spiritual experiences, I was so new to God (but still an atheist), that I think I told one other person. I wasnt confident in what I saw and I didnt want people to think I was crazy. Im uploading a file of the picture I drew of this vision.

1262,DEE,1369,50,,F,"At the age of 50, I had an experience that transformed my life. I had been working with a tool in a secluded area of my home. I left the room for a few minutes, but when I returned, the tool had \xe2\x80\x9cvanished\xe2\x80\x9d and was never seen again. After exhausting every possible explanation for the disappearance, I felt my world falling apart. For the next few days, all I could do was to walk round and round the house in the hope that somehow the tool would mysteriously reappear. The experience was like being thrown into an alien universe, where all the laws of the only universe I had ever known had ceased to exist \xe2\x80\x93 it was like living in a world without gravity. When I eventually regained my composure, I began thinking of ways to solve the mystery. I had heard that the CIA uses psychics, so I made an appointment with one of these people in my area. Although he could not see what had happened to the tool, the psychic indicated that a being on the other side wanted to communicate with me. He described her as wearing a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s uniform and giving her first name as Edith. He could not understand her surname, but he thought it started with a C or a K. When I suggested \xe2\x80\x9cEdith Cavell\xe2\x80\x9d, he told me that was correct. (He had obviously never heard of the remarkable English nurse). Through the psychic, Edith accurately described a pendant I owned. She said I should hold it completely still and then ask her a question. If the answer was \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99, the pendant would move one way; if the answer was \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99, it would move another way. Being of a sceptical disposition, I did not believe that something I owned could ever move of its own accord. But on arriving home, I did what Edith had suggested and to my absolute astonishment, the pendant moved as she had indicated \xe2\x80\x93 either vertically or horizontally. After a new months of fruitful yes/no communication, I asked Edith a question one day, but instead of its usual movements, the pendant swung around in a circle. Eventually I discovered that a circle indicated the need to rephrase the question. Not long after that, Edith changed her mode of communication to one where she caused my hand to move in different directions. Then one day I asked a question, but there was no response. It turned out that Edith was handing me over to someone else. The only way I could ascertain the name of this being was to go through the alphabet. I found it almost impossible to believe that the name of the new guide I was being given was Aristotle. I was in such a state of anxiety that I contacted a renowned psychic without giving him any information about myself. At the consultation he told me he was being given a vision of philosophers in Ancient Greece. This gave me reassurance that I was not losing my mind. Aristotle told me that I should apply to do a PhD in philosophy, and that I should do a lot of background reading. To this day I have never been to a philosophy lecture \xe2\x80\x93 let alone studied in the field. When I eventually rang the Professor I had chosen, he \xe2\x80\x9cforgot\xe2\x80\x9d to ask me about the previous work I had done in philosophy.  After being accepted by the University, I began a difficult journey, but I had a wonderful supervisor who carried me through. At one point Aristotle said I would need to use a concept by the very early philosopher, Anaximander. Of course I had never heard of this thinker, but I used his concept to unite the various ideas I was presenting. Later on, Aristotle handed me over to the modern French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. By this time I had become used to the miraculous, which was just as well, because I found Jacques\xe2\x80\x99 writing difficult to grasp. In the end, thanks to all the help I was given from the other side, the two examiners I had described my dissertation as \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d. (It is titled \xe2\x80\x9cHeidegger and the mystery of being\xe2\x80\x9d and is on the web). Among other things it addresses the question of mysticism, and I am now interested in relating mystical experiences to the idea of the divine. From what I have read in Dr. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s book, and from my own experience, it seems difficult to conceive of God as an all-powerful being who sends people to hell if they don\xe2\x80\x99t repent.

1264,DEE,1520,49,,M,"I had recently stopped drinking alcohol after 29 years of habitual and heavy drinking. My partner at the time was engaged in guided meditation and spiritual connection and growth. She convinced me to look to meditation and I discovered that I could use the pendulum quite successfully. I began to work very hard at the spiritual connection that I was forming. After a period of time i was able to hear messages and feel spiritual presence.I was shown the different spheres and told of the existence of other worlds and other dimensions. I had come to a point in my life where change was necessary. God had played a major part in my life until age 13....I felt divorced from him at age 49 and quite spiritually, emotionally and physically lost. In these early days of my transformation i was meditating and the room was flooded with a beautiful golden light. I felt myself being lifted from the chair....tears streamed down my face and the overwhelming message was to love God. From this point I began to understand that love was the key to change albeit with a great deal of hard personal work.

1267,DEE,1319,51,,F,"I awoke at 2:00 a.m. and noticed a dim light that appeared to be emanating from the wall in the hallway. I thought that was odd, as all the lights in our apartment were turned off and my husband was asleep in the living room. I sat up in bed to get a closer look when I saw two images very clearly displayed on the hallway wall, which appeared in the center of that dim light. They were two shadows, one in the shape of a butterfly and one in the shape of a dove. They were quite detailed. The butterfly, for example, had the veins in its wings prominently outlined as if it were made of stained glass- but it was a shadow, in black and white. The dove also appeared to resemble an image you might see on stained glass, only black and white. I sat up further and spoke out loud to myself: I am awake. This is real. What I am seeing is real... Then, the butterflys wings began to move and it flew up the wall and to the ceiling, where it disappeared. Next, the doves wings began to flutter, and it also moved up toward the ceiling and disappeared. I had the intense impression that this was a sign that I had moved in a positive spiritual direction that day, by having that talk earlier with my husband in which I opened up about myself. I felt very, very happy. Not ecstatic, just happy. I remember smiling intensely before going back to sleep.

For two hours I sat motionless while I recounted vivid memories of the man who had helped a boy whose father was killed when I was eight years old.

1285,OBE,1373,39,,F,"I copy here the experience exactly as I typed it then. This records my third experience. The first one occurred in February of 1984 and then August, 1984. The third one in January of 1985, as written.  Jan.26, 1985--it has happened again (On what I experienced in early morning, only half awake). There was a rushing sound, a roaring in my ears. I am half awake now, with consciousness of my surroundings, and also have the feeling I am about to plunge off a cliff, a falling sensation. I feel, just briefly, a sense of immovability--the way in a dream one tries to move and cant, and also a sense of fear arises at this. Then the images begin, the feeling one of plunging deep into a vortex, but everything is vividly clear, in color. The images are against a black background, and they are perfect crystalline forms, changing constantly, that make me think of snowflake forms at times, then of those theoretical models of chemical components or DNA, and then of pure rock crystal forms. The speed of the images is way beyond me, their transformations occurring without cessation. Nothing exists but this silent world I seem to have entered, as the forms recede and accelerate alternately in the darkness. Then they stop--disappear, and what I see at a vast distance in total blackness, as if I were looking through a telescope backwards, only infinitely smaller than that, is a tiny circle of light. I see it as if I am looking into a cauldron of light, barely glimpsed at such a distance, but it shifts and flickers on the edges. Only a tiny part of it is revealed to me, but the light is so clear it is like the interior of a diamond--a dazzling light, that oddly conveys a sense, for which I cannot account, that it has a knowledge of some sort--as if the light was source. Then a tingling feeling occurs and the image ends--it all goes away, and I sense my regular surroundings again. I try to go to sleep. The first time this happened, last February 84, I was scared silly.  The images occurred after I experienced the same roaring sound, but at that time (also an early hour, between 2 and 5 a.m.) there was also a loud cracking sound; in fact, that happened first. The images were, then, not immediately visible. They appeared finally in the center of a deep blackness at a great distance in a curling, churning fire of light, and accelerated toward me until I could see the swirling changing crystal forms. I stayed up an hour afterwards, writing it down. I felt then the same tingling sensation at the onset and end of the event, and the same moment of immovability. The second time (all told, it has happened three times) was last summer, August, 84. And now this one, around 4:30 or 5 a.m. The fear was briefer; I knew more of what to expect, and it was as if I willed myself to hold on. I had been asleep, wake up to the buzzing, electric sensation, and the rest, and then it begins. I let the images come. In the times between the 3 events Ive tried to make it happen, unsuccessfully. Each time has occurred only spontaneously. Each time I feel I have encountered something with great energy or power within it. I feel it will happen again--that there is more to learn. Especially within that light. It frightens me, yet I sense it has meaning, validity. I wonder at its meaning, and seek it out.

1294,OBE,1229,44,,M,"Almost immediately after taking the divine plant I began to fall out of my body. It was a wholly new sensation for me. After years of pursuing the actual out of body occurrence it was nothing as I had imagined it to be. There is noting that can compare one for the actual sensation. During numerous mediations I had always imagined myself rising above my body to look down and view myself. But this is not what actually happened. I actually fell into myself. I literally fell out of myself and by falling inside myself. And then instantly found myself floating above my body laying on the bed. The experience of being pulled out of the body was not an unpleasant sensation rather it was the first time to feel it and all firsts are usually associated with some fear. In this case it happened so fast and the train I was on had no exit routes, so I was on it for the duration. Once I was above my body the experience was quite pleasant. I was amazed at how I looked. I also notice the family cat was aware of my presence which I found quite interesting as it gazed upon my astral body. Just as I was becoming acquainted with my new surroundings I was yanked yet again in another direction at an astounding rate through a tunnel towards a light. Upon reaching the end of the tunnel I seemed to be deposited on the other side of a threshold. This place was completely and utterly spectacular. I was suddenly connected to everything was the feeling I remember most. I only needed to think of something and the associated response was with me. The communication was so much different here. I wasnt thinking in words but pictures associated with strong feelings and emotions. And I was like a newborn. I had very little experience in this new environment. It was very much a fish out of water experience. The thing that left the most lasting impression on me was this. I was able to look back on where I had just come from. The physical world. It was close. I could perceive it clearly as if it were a separate dimension but very close. I began to focus on the edges of it as it didnt seem to be wholly formed yet. The colors were so vibrant and alive.  So organic. The edges looked like caviar. And It came into me that I was perceiving the physical on a molecular level. I was so amazed. Then suddenly it came through me like a lightening bolt. These molecules perceived me. They were aware I was looking at them. Communication!! Images and information passed at an alarming rate. I was aware of the rythme and reason for everything coming into being. It filled me with a sense of joy I had never felt before. I laughed. I knew what life really was. These small bits of life....molecules...all formed based on collective thoughts. We all were creating everyday. We just didnt realize how powerful our thoughts we were. Then I was aware of a presence behind me. It was so brite and so large. My first thoughts were not of intrigue but of how small and dim I was. And just this tiny bit of hesitation flooded me with thoughts of....had I killed myself. Suddenly I was flooded with thoughts of fear. I wanted to know if I was alive. I yearned to feel my body again. So I prayed to feel my body again. And I was propelled in that direction. It was not an easy maneuver. It took some time to anchor myself in my body but it was accomplished. I had set up a timer on the side of the night stand. Total duration was 15 minutes. It had felt like an eternity. There was actually no sensation of time where I had gone. It did not exist.

1299,NDA,1386,17,,F,"One night, I had a dream. I remember being outside of my grandfather house. Outside of the house was my grandfather. He approached me, and we were happy to see each other. I knew it had been a while since I saw him. And, I also knew that she was currently sick and afraid of him leaving me [to the afterlife]. My grandfather took my hand, and we walked into his house. The view inside the house, during the dream, was identical to his real house. What I found unusual was that all the lights were out except the one straight ahead- his room.  As we proceeded to walk towards his room, he was telling me that things were going to be fine. That, at first, things were going to feel like they are spinning out of control. As if I was standing with my arms out, spinning in circles, losing my balance- THAT type of loss of control. Although I found comfort in his words, I didnt know what he actually meant, until after his death.  When we approached the bedroom door, I could not believe my eyes. In front of me, was a hospital bed and my grandfather was in it! My grandfather was in his bed, facing my direction; he was asleep. Behind him, sitting, was his 2nd wife, his daughter, Lucy, and his son, Danny. To my left [and my grandfathers], sitting on a chair, was my mother. All of them were looking straight at my grandfather. I could not believe that I was in the presence of two grandfathers- and the same one!!  Seeing my grandfather in the hospital bed created a magnetic pull. I could not remove my eyes from him. I had never seen him in such a state. He was always alert, active, and immediately greeting me. This was the first time that I ever saw him so disconnected from everyone else, especially in their presence.  Seeing that there was an empty chair right next to his bed, I immediately sat on it. I felt I was trying to be close to him as I possibly could. This was the man I had loved all my life. He was my father, my comfort, and my strength. I admired this man profusely. And, knowing that I had denied seeing him for so many months, he needed to know I was finally there.  I apologized to him for not being there for when he needed me the most. I told him I was scared of losing him and I was scared that he would pass away once he already saw me. (He had seen every family member, but me. Due to how our relationship was, my withdrawal had shocked everyone. I thought you loved your grandfather, why arent you seeing him? You know that he is dying. Go see him.) Once I finished venting to my grandfather, asking him for forgiveness, his eyes opened. He looked at me. I returned the look. And he closed them again. Right then I knew that I was right. He WAS waiting for me. He wasnt leaving yet because we hadnt said goodbye. And I was the last person that he needed to see. But, I knew that I wasnt ready to let him go. Feeling overwhelmed, I reached out to him. I went for his hand and I grabbed it. It was my first touch with him in months. And once I held his hand, I heard his last breath. I was then informed he died. Everyone around was crying, including myself. With the pain of a broken heart, and having everything feel so real, I immediately woke up from my dream. I woke up sweating and bursting into tears. I could not stop crying. I had felt as if my grandfather had truly passed away.  My mother, who was sleeping next to me at the time (she didnt want to be alone during this moment in her life- being a daddys girl) woke up with fright. She didnt know what happened to me. I relived the dream by telling her every single detail. She reached out to a relative who informed her that my grandfather was still alive. - Exactly one week later, still fearful of my dream, and still avoiding seeing my dying grandfather, my mom informed me that she had just seen my grandfather. She informed me that now it was just a matter of hours or minutes. Without thinking, I immediately got ready. It was probably 10:00-11:00 at night. On my way over there, those fears werent present. But once I walked up to my grandfathers door- all my fears came flooding back. I did not know what to expect. Was my dream just a dream? Or, would it become a reality?? As my mother and I walked in through the door. My heart slumped to the bottom of my stomach. Just like my dream- the house was dark except for the back room- my grandfathers room. I began to experience anxiety. I was praying my steps towards the room would be nothing like my dream. I had so much hope in those few seconds which felt like an hour. When I walked into the bedroom, there he was: my grandfather laying on a bed, facing my direction. Behind him, my 2nd wife, my aunt Lucy, and my uncle Danny. My mother took a seat to my left. And I, I was offered the empty seat next to him. The seat from my dreams!  I had so many thoughts come up.

1310,ME ,1294,61,,F,"During the summer of 2006, Hank and I were at an outdoor party at a swim club in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. We had met this group of people the year before, so they were new to us. It was a sunny day and I was talking to a very suntanned man everyone called Mike the Painter, to distinguish him, I suppose, from all the other Mikes. While I was talking to Mike, his whole face suddenly turned a deathly gray color. It happened in a snap, as if you turned on a light and boom! I guess it was shocking to see because my brain took a couple of seconds before I realized that his face had changed to gray. His face was gray for several seconds and then it snapped back to his normal tan color. I stood there staring at him. I dont remember what he was saying. I do not drink or do drugs. After that happened and in the next day or two, I remember thinking about Mikes face and wondering if it did indeed turn gray. I couldnt believe I saw his whole face a gray color. I tried to disbelieve this experience had happened to me. I tried to deny that his face had turned gray. But every time I tried to deny it, I kept affirming that I did indeed see that Mikes face instantly turned gray, stayed gray for several seconds, then instantly turned back to tan. Since Im a visual person and a visual artist, I couldnt deny that I saw his face was gray because my mind sort of takes a picture of it and, also, I was able to call it up in my memory and I would see it again, so I couldnt really deny the gray color. I ended up believing that this happened, even if I didnt understand why it happened or why I saw it. A day or two later I understood what I saw and why I saw it. Mike was a heavy smoker. He was usually smoking a cigarette whenever I saw him. I believed that God wanted me to warn Mike to stop smoking or hell pass at a young age. I waited a whole year before I got up the courage to tell Mike. I didnt want this new group of friends to think I was a religious zealot or crazy. So that summer I went up to Mike and told him what I saw and that I was meant to pass this warning to him. I apologized if he thought I was a zealot but Mike stopped me and said he was Catholic and believed that people see signs from God. He said he wasnt going to stop smoking and thanked me for telling him. I saw Mike every summer for a few years after that time and noticed that he was still smoking. Hank and I have since changed our summer plans so I dont expect to see Mike at that location again.

1315,ADC,1377,51,,M,This is the actual text message I sent Subject: Message from Mum Hi Lone Im just awake and have just finished relaying to Sue a dream I have just finished having about an hour ago. This was unlike ANYTHING I have ever experienced in my life and I guess u may believe what Im about to say or not then thats fine. It was a message from Mum for me and us all. Ill try to describe it but the detail was as good if not better than real life. Ok this is what I was shown and told by Mum mainly. Others I saw were Dad and you. Everyone is happy and come and go busy doing exactly what they want in real life just the same. Same voices same mannerisms and smiling. As you think of some one some place or some thing it materialises and its there for you to touch use and even the smells are the same. The detail blew me away as Mum walked me from room to room by my arm and showed me that her home is still alive and well and shes home living there with all her gear pictures everything. I saw the laundry all full. I gave Mum a big kiss and she was happy to see me and have me visit. Each room was perfect right down to the wood grain on the cupboard doors and wardrobes. It was clearer than I can even remember now. I could touch and feel everything. I said can I look in the huts and I did opening the door and checking both out. The smell was the same lol. They were full of junk And I said to Mum how come and she said we keep all the extra gear in there because us kids arnt there. When I was inside the house if I concentrated real hard I could almost see the burnt walls and floors like a shadow or silhouette but Mum said to me firmly with a serious look on her face that she is NOT going to allow me to see that and it vanished. She said that our home exists in two different places at once. Its like one place is on 92fm and her place is 102fm. They share the same place or space but out of tune so u dont see the other. Anyway we had visitors come and go with cups of tea. Dad arrived in from up the farm smiling and whistling. You arrived for a visit and chat also happy and smiling. Everything coming and going as I thought of them. When I was in Mums old bedroom with the built in mirror I tried to look at myself but when I did I was like a ghost. Very faint and just a shape. And yet I could see the bloody grain in the varnished doors right beside. We went to the A&amp;P show and there were not many people there but it was on. What happens is only the people you knew and think about come through. This explains how in the spirit world its not jammed packed with every person who has passed on just your loved ones and friends coming and going like real life. Ok back home again and Muns really young and beautiful probably in her twenties. See they can appear as any age they want. I knew it was mum. I swung her around then she fell over a chair laughing. I had tea with Mum and now the afternoon was getting darker it was time for me to go. I have her a big hug and began to cry with joy. I knew I was experiencing a dream but it was much too real for just a memory and I could ask questions. I thought I would wake Sue with my crying but I went back to Mum. She smiled and said she is happy and well and not to fear. I asked her if I could come and visit her again but she got serious again and said no but she will think about it. I said how about once a week and I begged her but she smiled and said maybe. Oh well I thought. I walked out the gate and some guys standing on the driveway who looked like Eddie yates. He was wearing a parka and there was a farm implement behind him. I said to him who are you ? and he told me his name. Random spirits appear too and he was out the gate and seemed to be waiting for Dad to come out to see him. I hopped into my car yes u can drive in the afterlife but its cool . You dont have miles of boring nothingness. Next second Im on my way home to Hokitika and I stop in a town. I got out at a park and some guys sitting there in his car with his mouth wide open looking at me. I said what are u looking at ? He says you are bloody flying and floating up in the air. I said so ... You can too come on up so he hops out and flies up to me. He was hopeless and tumbled over. I laughed. Then I awoke in bed at home with tears running down my cheeks and so bloody happy I had to wake Sue and relay this story. It was not a dream but was a real experience. It was like a near death experience without the death. I could see anything I wanted and ask questions at will. I feel a lot more content about home and Mum and I have been shown a glimpse of heaven. It was SOOO nice I can see why Mum is restricting my return. If u stay and dont go back you die and its not my time. But we are allowed to visit but only when our loved ones allow us.

1316,DEE,1420,15,,M,"On the third day in the hospital, the day I had planned to end my life, I spent the only night of my treatment without a roommate. In hindsight, however, I know that I was not alone that evening. During a period of intense reflection, I decided to open the Bible that was provided in each room. I casually flipped through the pages and eventually turned to the back cover where someone had scribbled a few of their favorite verses, one of which was Ecclesiastes 7:17. I immediately located chapter 7 / verse 17 in the very top right corner of the page, next to the page number of 717, where the number 717 was scratched in pen directly above the page number. I was strangely comforted and terrified simultaneously as I read the words, \xe2\x80\x9cBe not over much wicked; neither be thou foolish. Why shouldest thou die before thy time.\xe2\x80\x9d The rest of the chapter proceeds to advise the reader against submitting to the extremes of both righteousness and wickness, foolishness and wisdom, and purity and profane. Ill always have a physical monument of this miraculous affirmation of Gods love for me because, like the heathen I am, I took advantage of my lone solitary evening in the hospitial to secretly remove the passage which I carry on my person to this day.  Though I did not realize it until ten years after the fact, this was a covenent with God that was initiated before I ever even entered the hospital. Shortly before I plotted my suicide and entered the hospital, I had carved a cross into my chest and filled it with black ink as I selfishly pleaded with God to end my girlfriends unintended pregnancy. At the age of fifteen, my shortsighted naivity deluded my judgment into thinking this child would mark the end of my existence. Shortly thereafter, my girlfriend miscarried an innocent life whose destiny was not its own. I had desperately pleaded with God to change the course of my life and received more than I bargained for when, to my surprise, our covenent was sealed during that third evening in that hospital. The undoubted reason that God used the trifect appearance of 717 to get my attention is because 717 indicates the month and day of my birth on July 17, 1987. It was through this miracle that God sealed our first covenant with the symbol of 717. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a wealth of revelations that have continued to unfold through the present day.

It is BLACK! no stars, no planets, no lights, NOTHING! Void. A black hole I dont know what else to call it. Except in a very, very, very far distance is a very small gold and I mean GOLD light flickering like a candle or generator running off cycle or something. I began to get closer and closer. The GOLD light grew larger and larger and closer and closer. As I got close enough I could tell what looked like a snow globe or very lucent clear crystal ball and this GOLD light was inside this globe. As I got closer I could tell inside this globe were what looked like stars. Sort of looking into the sky from earth. But inside this globe these stars were very bright or a crystal or bright white. It is nothing I have ever seen before or can compare to it. There were no bright and dim stars, they were all the same. In this middle was this Golf glowing light. I did not go inside this and was kept at a distance hanging out in this blackness. On the way all I could feel is a state of AWE! no words, just a beyond any middle boggling experience anyone could have imagined. On this travel it was like your mind is wondering out there and focused on this GOLD light thinking what is going on?. Getting closer to this globe I noticed I began getting messages or bits of information or something that seem to be sending these messages to me. These messages begin telling me some things I need to work on. Which I did not understand at all. I am beginning to get a better understanding each day since. There were many messages or I guess even judgements that I received in which stated I did or just point out or something (still processing) but three Primary things I need to do before I am to enter or go to or inside this globe. There is way too much for me to put onto here. All I know is I was told to do this. One of my things is that I am to teach, speak, talk about Forgiveness. As this is one of my things I have to do and that is because this is the best way to learn it. This is all for now as I need to go rest. (try to sleep). I really cannot put into words what happened but it was very real to me. I was not on any drugs these nights and am not now either. I cant stand the pain drugs, although I know many wanting them. This was one week out of surgery when this travel happened. I had two profound experiences in the hospital which I am finding out stuff now and it is no words to describe.

1319,DEE,1158,9,,M,"As the night passed I would fall into and out of sleep, waking when I became cold with chills or hot from the fever. At one point during the night I had awoken again from the fever and at that time I became more aware that my illness was worse, much worse than my parents had originally thought. I definitely dont believe my parents were aware of just how ill I was because had they know they would have taken me to a doctor. At this point when I awoke from the fever I was delirious again and wanted to get up and wake my parents to tell them how sick I was but I didnt have the strength to get up or yell for them. I was very distressed by this time as I just intuitively knew I was very ill and I needed help, but was helpless as I could not speak let alone get up to tell my parents. Just as I thought my fever couldnt get any worse and as I laid helpless in my bed a white-golden light started to appear to my left and I turned my eyes to see this white-golden light begin to form against the wall. This white-golden light began to take shape until it became three separate beings, all bathed in the white-golden light they formed from, a white-golden light that seemed to dance all around them. They did not speak, they did not look directly at me, but instead they stood silently with heads bowed. I do remember they were all dressed in what I can only describe as a monks robe, with the hood and large sleeves. As soon as I saw the beings of light I immediately began to feel better, I no longer felt feverish, my aches stopped and my strength was coming back. Prior to that moment I was feeling the worse I had all night and my fever and delirium still had a grip on me, yet the moment I began to see the beings forming my fever dissipated and the delirium went away. Once the beings were fully formed my thinking was completely clear again, no delirium and my fever and aches were gone. The overwhelming feeling of complete serenity, peace and calm came over me, I was not afraid of the beings in the least and instinctively knew they were there for me, then just as suddenly as the golden beings of light had appeared they faded away.

It became clear to me that this blanket of love was made by numerous souls who were concerned and sending their love. This love was enormous and the concern was like from a mother towards her children. It became clear to me that the love was there and it could heal if people wanted to.

1333,ME ,1314,33,,M,"I awake to nothing. No body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space: no near, no far, no light or dark. No heat, no cold. No emotion: no joy, no fear. Just calm awareness in a gray void.  A moment / eternity passes. Light! A brilliant sun! And with it, darkness: the fullness of empty space. A small human figure stands in silhouette. My consciousness shifts. I become the figure; a human body standing in space before a radiant globe. I feel! I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished.  I become aware that what had first appeared like a sun is un-like anything from ordinary reality. I am in the presence of a radiant, fluid luminosity. An amalgam of water and light is the best approximation I can think of. The sense of being before a conscious presence intensifies.  My mind buzzes with the desire to hold It, to explain and contain It with my thought. The more I grasp, however, the more It slips away. It cannot be grasped or named. I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away. I become light. I am one with the light. I am the light, a fluid, radiant luminosity. I have no body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light.  A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body. A thought is expressed without words: approach your live with joy and gratitude; compassion and acceptance. A cosmic chuckle: clear-eyed and hard-nosed. I am laughed at/with. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take your self so seriously\xe2\x80\x9d rings in my mind. As I turn from the light a frigorific presence rushes from behind and past my left ear. It is a transparent nothingness consuming all energy in its path. It radiates a cold animus and an implacable will to be separate; to differentiate. As it rushes past an iron darkness warps around me. It fuses to me and I become dark and solid. I awake to an ordinary day.

1334,DEE,1399,51,,M,"I could hear people speaking who were around me, was well aware of my surroundings--I did not expect this visitation to happen. I had said a little prayer (just in case) asking for forgiveness for those I had directly or indirectly hurt, and waited to die--so I thought. I wondered what it would feel like; i.e., would the lights just go out, would it be painful, or what. I could not tell the sex of my visitor, it appeared to clothed in a lovely robe-like material, was very human in appearance, had a lovely smile, appeared gentle and loving and I could see through it. What surprised me most is that it spoke to me without words. The thoughts just jumped into my mind. It knew what I wanted to know just as I had the thought develop in my mind, and I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d Looking back on the experience, that thought makes me smile every time I think about it--it really happened that way. The message was that of love, that it did not matter whether I lived or died--I would be cared for. Finally, the overriding message was, LOVE WAS ALL THAT MATTERED and I did not need to worry. The visitor stayed with me for some time (several minutes) and when I turned to look away, out the cabin window, I could see the lights of a city below. When I turned back, my visitor was gone. In a way, this proved how real the visitation was. It was NO dream. After the plane landed, I was met by an ambulance and taken to Daniel Freeman Hospital. Thinking that I had a Mexican GI upset I was taken to a ward treating GI problems, a nurse noticed that my blood pressure dropped to nearly zero, I was then rushed to a CC unit and placed under the care of a cardiologist, Dr. Ciralo (sp?). There I was diagnosed with severe cardiac dilatation and heart failure, it wasnt until later that a pheochromocytoma was discovered. I was severely hypertensive and apparently this was the cause of my heart failure. When my hypertensive condition was brought under control, my heart returned to normal. This was all documented by ultrasonography and angiography. The pheochromocytoma was removed from my abdomen 1 month later at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. I think back on the experience and still worry about the unknown, but listening to the audio tape of your book has helped restore my faith in the reality of my experience. Thank you!!

The angle knew that I was very upset about the direction of humanity after 911 and told me, not with spoken words, but with telepathic words, that everything would be ok and that I needed to keep reminding people what brought us to that point. I needed to speak of bring love and not focus on hate or enemies. The angel told me it knew I felt very alone but to remember that I was not and that I should keep putting out the message of love. It touched my face and then it slowly vanished.

His face was gray for several seconds and then it snapped back to his normal tan color. I stood there staring at him. I dont remember what he was saying. I do not drink or do drugs. After that happened and in the next day or two, I remember thinking about Mikes face and wondering if it did indeed turn gray. I couldnt believe I saw his whole face a gray color.

But every time I tried to deny it, I kept affirming that I did indeed see that Mikes face instantly turned gray, stayed gray for several seconds, then instantly turned back to tan. Since Im a visual person and a visual artist, I couldnt deny that I saw his face was gray because my mind sort of takes a picture of it and, also, I was able to call it up in my memory and I would see it again, so I couldnt really deny the gray color. I ended up believing that this happened, even if I didnt understand why it happened or why I saw it. A day or two later I understood what I saw and why I saw it. Mike was a heavy smoker. He was usually smoking a cigarette whenever I saw him. I believed that God wanted me to warn Mike to stop smoking or hell pass at a young age. I waited a whole year before I got up the courage to tell Mike. I didnt want this new group of friends to think I was a religious zealot or crazy. So that summer I went up to Mike and told him what I saw and that I was meant to pass this warning to him. I apologized if he thought I was a zealot but Mike stopped me and said he was Catholic and believed that people see signs from God. He said he wasnt going to stop smoking and thanked me for telling him. I saw Mike every summer for a few years after that time and noticed that he was still smoking. Hank and I have since changed our summer plans so I dont expect to see Mike at that location again.

1348,ADC,1172,54,,F,"While drifting off to sleep, a man appeared at the foot of my bed, dressed in an old uniform, which I later discovered was an army uniform, and he was smiling and looked happy. He obviously wanted me to see him, as he just stood there, and I said, What are you doing here? And I was totally calm, not scared at all, and then he faded away. My husband in the next room heard what I had said and shouted back, What? And I answered, oh, nothing and I knew that something significant had happened, but didnt know for sure what. The next day, I asked my mother and sister if my Uncle Dan had ever served in the army, and the answer was yes. I really believe that Dan appeared to me because I am receptive to these kinds of experiences, and because he wanted my mother to know that he was o.k., in his young body, and no longer afflicted by the physical problems he had before he died. I thought then that the real purpose of his visit was so that my mother could tell his wife, who still survived, that he was o.k. My mother never did tell her, as she was not a believer of these kinds of things. My mother passed away recently, and Dans daughter, my cousin, sent me a card that stated that her dad adored my mother, his little sister. I now know that purpose of his visit was not so that his wife would know that he was o.k., but so that his sister, whom he adored, would know that he was o.k.

1349,OBE,1142,27,,F,"I suddenly found myself out of my body looking at myself on the couch sleeping, I walked around the apartment and kept referring back to myself on the couch just to check for security for some reason it was comforting to know I was there even if I wasnt completely inside of myself any longer. I went into the bathroom in this spirit form and saw a great statue perched on the closed toilet seat that looked like a statue but I didnt realize it was the angel of death but either way I didnt feel any fear from it. I saw some mini creatures that were about 2-3 feet in size going into the drain of the bathtub happily and willingly and as the approached the drain they would spin as if being flushed and I could see this great release on their faces and wanted to experience that same release too. So I decided to follow them and the moment I willingly resigned my soul for it to be permitted to be flushed down the bathtub drain I felt for the first time complete separation of myself from something that had always been with me but because I had never been without it I didnt know I had always had it...that was this connection to God. It was only in that vortex that I immediately knew I had made a mistake by stepping into that bathtub drain and called out to God and asked him to take me back to my body on the couch over and over but the tunnel vortex thing I was in spinning inside of and going deeper felt so isolated and I felt so alone and felt that my pleading and cries couldnt even be heard from God. Then the angel I had seen perched on top of the toilet next to the bathtub swooped down and caught me as I was decending in the vortex and I began to justify myself to God asking why would you permit the angel of death to personally escort me to Hell I am not a bad person? I didnt know God had heard my cries finally I saw myself ascending through the floor boards of my apartment and the angel just rolled my spirit like a basketball down the angels arms and back into my body exactly as I was when I left it on the couch. The moment I was rolled out of the angels arms and placed back in my body I instantly opened my eyes and inhaled my life back into me and I knew that I had died for a short while but I didnt know exactly how it had happened. I stayed in that posistion awake asking God if I had had a heart attack or something...this experience changed my outlook on life.

1352,OBE,1410,22,,F,"It really happened very very quickly. One minute I was watching tv and then I believe I had fallen asleep. All of a sudden I felt myself come out of my body and in a flash, my spirit, or whatever you want to call it, was out of my body, across the room, in front of the television. I saw the television and then I was just there, right in front of it. It was still on but I cant recall what was showing at the time this happened, I just know it was on and I could see it. I remember feeling this amazing sense of freedom and that I could go anywhere I wanted, as quickly as I wanted. I looked at the hotel room door and thought to myself, I want to go out there, see how far I can go like this. It was a very very pleasant and unbelievably exciting feeling, but I was also scared.  In that instant while I was looking at the door thinking about going further, reveling in this sense of freedom, speed and excitement, I suddenly I heard a voice (it wasnt a voice like we speak in the literal world, it was a voice that I could identify as male, I think, but instead of speaking out loud, it was like a knowledge in my head. Its hard to convey this correctly) saying If you want this to stop, you have to wake up now. I heard it and was still looking at the door. The voice/knowledge again said Sally, if you want this to stop you have to wake up NOW! with heavy heavy emphasis on the word NOW.  This time I listened and the next thing I knew, I was back in my body, sitting up and sucking in a HUGE gulp of air as if I hadnt taken a breath in a very long time, the same way you would if you were holding your breath under water for as long as you could stand and then surfaced. I was so scared of what I had just experienced I ran to the min-refrigerator, grabbed one of the beers from the six pack i had bought earlier, along with my cigarettes, and went outside where I drank the entire beer and smoked probably 4 cigarettes in a row. I was TERRIFIED to go back to sleep. I truly felt like I was going crazy and imagining what had just happened to me. When I finally went back to my room I stayed up as long as I could because I was afraid to go back to sleep and that it would happen again. At the time, I didnt want it to happen ever again. I finally did go back to sleep and slept peacefully the remaining few hours I had left before my flight. It has never happened to me again.

1357,OBE,1133,39,,M,"The night before I had this experience was a very emotional point in my life, the world seemed so terribly unjust and cruel that I was at a breaking point, that evening when arriving home walking from my car to the front door I paused to look up into the star filled sky with tears rolling down my cheeks quietly cried Why, why, why? I could not understand how the complete innocents of this world could be treated so terribly, how children could suffer so unjustly under the hand of others. I cried to sky as the universe because I could not believe in a God and had little faith in anything spiritual, if any.  Since rejecting the belief in God at the age of about 22, I did not believe such a thing could exist, because any such God which would allow these kinds of things to happen wasnt any kind of God to me. I couldnt pray to the concept of God but the universe was real, the immense out there, the all that is was something I could pour out my heart to without needing a belief in God. That night I gave the heavens my full heart seeking an answer to that question, with all my heart tearfully pleading for the answer. The next afternoon I received an answer to that question; since we are all a part of one another we do it to ourselves.  Although the answer didnt completely make up for all of the pain, much of the edge of that pain was taken off by finally being able to understand why such terrible things could happen to others in our world, to simply understand we have the freedom of choice to do such things because in the wider perspective the reality is we are all one and in that hurting no one else other than ourselves. Because of this and this alone we are allowed the freedom to do good or evil, if we werent really one I do not believe the spiritual heart of life would allow such to occur, call that center God, the conscious collective, the collective soul or what ever name you might choose. I finally came to understand, in the end we all pay the price for any wrong as well as reap the reward for any good and this took away much of the anger I had against reality for allowing terrible things to happen to good people.  The following is how the answer came to me through a dream-vision which was the most lucid moment of my life before or since but I must also add the following; the experience and my conclusions from it are my own made from who I am as a individual and how I saw the experience. Was it really God on high I met? I thought it was but beyond my own belief I cannot say it was, perhaps I met a collective soul which was so wonderful to me I thought it was God when in fact God might be levels above, so to speak,.   The Vision: Meeting a Sun-Intelligence-God. Sun of Souls~Souls of Sun; One Spirit~One Life.  Note: This experience was no doubt individually viewed through my own shade of colored glasses, limited to my own ability to understand things at the time, how I needed to be shown who we really are. This may have been brought on by severe apnea, a problem I had where I could stop breathing for long periods of time. I believe I may have stopped breathing for far too long that afternoon and had come close to death producing this NDE-like experience. I dont really know if this was a OOBE or due to apnea, but either way, what ever caused the experience it deeply impacted my outlook on life, what and who we really are.  One warm afternoon in 1996 I took a short nap and unexpectedly awoke within my slumber to find myself in a vast void in the presence of a huge sun or sphere of light, quickly coming to the understanding that this sun was pure conscious awareness. I was completely surprised to find myself so fully conscious in this empty but light-filled void which I knew to be more real than waking reality, in this place feeling super-conscious beyond anything I had experienced before. Although the light was without any kind of visual hint of facial features, I strongly sensed it smiling nothing but love for me and through those feelings knowing an unseen face.  While in the presence of this light I immediately and fully felt it peering deeply into my own awareness, lovingly knowing everything about me all at once. Feeling such love coming from this light I suddenly came to an awareness that this sun was God! I was so overwhelmed and surprised that God was real that I mentally gasped and then yelled out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Real!\xe2\x80\x9d. Just prior to this experience I had a deep mistrust of religion and rejected the concept of any kind of God or creator, much less the idea there was any continuation for human beings beyond our physical lives. Years before this experience, I had decided for many seemingly valid reasons that religion and God were only a product of the human mind, yet there I was standing in the presence of what I knew without a doubt wa",,USA    Q.,"25,000",agnostic,atheist,Christian,Christian,,,dail,never,very strong,littl,"50,000 99",Did not,Satelli,,marri,single,Yes,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

It was odd as it seemed as though it was daytime not nighttime.

Shortly after that point I felt or sensed something above me. A feeling of warm love and a golden light radiating from above but all around caught my attention. As it did, I slowly ascended towards this wonderful place above me but after a few moment I felt the presence of two beings.

I took a greater interest in the lush trees and foliage to my right as the SUV continued along the bridge and the land dropped away.

1365,DEE,1420,15,,M,"On the third day in the hospital, the day I had planned to end my life, I spent the only night of my treatment without a roommate. In hindsight, however, I know that I was not alone that evening. During a period of intense reflection, I decided to open the Bible that was provided in each room. I casually flipped through the pages and eventually turned to the back cover where someone had scribbled a few of their favorite verses, one of which was Ecclesiastes 7:17. I immediately located chapter 7 / verse 17 in the very top right corner of the page, next to the page number of 717, where the number 717 was scratched in pen directly above the page number. I was strangely comforted and terrified simultaneously as I read the words, \xe2\x80\x9cBe not over much wicked; neither be thou foolish. Why shouldest thou die before thy time.\xe2\x80\x9d The rest of the chapter proceeds to advise the reader against submitting to the extremes of both righteousness and wickness, foolishness and wisdom, and purity and profane. Ill always have a physical monument of this miraculous affirmation of Gods love for me because, like the heathen I am, I took advantage of my lone solitary evening in the hospitial to secretly remove the passage which I carry on my person to this day.  Though I did not realize it until ten years after the fact, this was a covenent with God that was initiated before I ever even entered the hospital. Shortly before I plotted my suicide and entered the hospital, I had carved a cross into my chest and filled it with black ink as I selfishly pleaded with God to end my girlfriends unintended pregnancy. At the age of fifteen, my shortsighted naivity deluded my judgment into thinking this child would mark the end of my existence. Shortly thereafter, my girlfriend miscarried an innocent life whose destiny was not its own. I had desperately pleaded with God to change the course of my life and received more than I bargained for when, to my surprise, our covenent was sealed during that third evening in that hospital. The undoubted reason that God used the trifect appearance of 717 to get my attention is because 717 indicates the month and day of my birth on July 17, 1987. It was through this miracle that God sealed our first covenant with the symbol of 717. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a wealth of revelations that have continued to unfold through the present day.

1367,DEE,1124,47,,M,"Testimony on God\xe2\x80\x99s Power As revealed to Conrad February 5, 2007, 6:25AM to 9:25AM Introduction My name is Conrad; I was born in the Philippines and was raised in a Roman Catholic family. I was an altar boy during my Catechism years. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the bible twice from cover to cover when I was young and every time I get to the crucifixion part, I cried. Some parts of the bible I would easily understand, but I also got confused in others. As I grew up a verse from the bible kept playing in my mind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which part of the bible it came from but it went like this \xe2\x80\x9cSeek ye first the Kingdom of God \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d and that is what I did. I went about seeking the Kingdom of God, read many books of different titles and pretty soon I discovered the wonders of Science and how it can reasonably explain things that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. The more science books I read the more convinced I was that things that were once mysterious can be scientifically explained and verified. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed in proving things undoubtedly before I believed it and accepted it. I only wanted to believe in known and proven facts.  And so I went through College and read even more books and gained more knowledge. I excelled in class but not good enough to have any honors because of my laziness and procrastination. You see, I would do well in exams, in fact I\xe2\x80\x99d be top in exams but not accomplish my homework or lab works so I also had grades that were just average. As my learning progressed I discovered that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need God to have a life or to live my life. I believed this with conviction and even had a theory that men created God and not the other way around. I wrote a thesis on how during the early stages of evolution men might have created God because there were many things they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand or were unable to explain. They attributed those things to an all knowing creator and consequently created a God. A friend of mine presented it as an English class project and almost got kicked out by the instructor. (That\xe2\x80\x99s how blasphemous it appeared but when you think deeper you can discern that men if left alone will instinctively seek God. We are the only creation that actively seek and try to understand our origins.) I went on with my life for years not believing or needing God until I got married to my wife Elisa in 1986 when we were both working in the Middle East. Our marriage did not give a child for almost five years. We went to see doctors and specialists in hospitals and clinics but we were unsuccessful. A surgery for me and standard medical procedures done for my wife did not result in conception. I desperately wanted a child and I would do anything to have one. I started wondering \xe2\x80\x9cAm I being punished for not believing in God?\xe2\x80\x9d Despite all these disappointments, we continued seeing fertility specialists. We also had Artificial Insemination in the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines. In December 1989, we went back to the Philippines for a much needed month long vacation. And one Sabbath day in January 1990, at the Manila Center (an SDA church in Manila, Philippines), a pastor from California was leading a service and he had a sermon about the earth being like a washing machine for dirty souls. He said \xe2\x80\x9cThe Earth is used by God to wash and clean souls to make them fit to go to heaven and live with God.\xe2\x80\x9d It opened my mind and I understood then why I needed God in my life. I wept and cried uncontrollably. It caught the Pastor\xe2\x80\x99s attention and I guess he pitied my poor soul so much that he gave me his Bible and even signed it. That night I prayed hard, a really sincere prayer to God and I asked Him to give me a child. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d I prayed \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a real God, and really powerful God, give me a child and I will convert to the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\xe2\x80\x9d Back to the UAE on February 1990, my wife tested positive for pregnancy and in November 29, 1990, our daughter Ari was born. I thought about my promise to God and the implications of that promise. My parents and siblings, my Catholic friends would hate me I thought, I would miss food that I grew accustomed to eating. I cringed at these possibilities and so I kept living my life the way I wanted and I justified my actions with some semi-scientific reasoning to deny God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing of a daughter for my wife and me. Fast forward to 2007, we have since moved to the US, we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in Boca Raton, Florida, New Orleans, LA and presently, The Woodlands, TX.

1370,NDE,1052,42,,F,"As I was holding my son I began praying (to a God that I hoped existed although I certainly was not sure actually did...too much scientist in me). As I held him and prayed I became keenly aware of this dark presence following quickly behind my son and me. This awareness was not in real time but still, an intense awareness of this strong force. I began having chills and intestinal disturbances and felt true terror. As I felt this force nearing both of us and about to encircle us. I was very aware that this force was actually the dark angel of death. My prayer changed from please God, allow my son to live to God, if you have to take him then he is your child not mine. And I am aware that I am your child as well and you will have to help me. At that precise moment I felt a shift in my sons breathing. In the upper left corner of the room I became aware of a brilliant and luminescent light. This light slowly grew and filled the upper quadrant of the darkened room. I honestly thought that I was having a stress induced migraine and was having an aura. However, when I turned my head the aura did not follow with my movements. The light remained in that left upper corner of the room. The brightness of it grew and grew and enlarged to where it filled the room. I tried to look at the light but it was too bright. The light was the most brilliant and beautiful light that I have even seen. I had never (and still have never) seen anything like it. It was more than light...like it had consistancy. And then this incredible awareness occurred and my thought was oh my God, its God. And in that moment I becamse aware that God was/is more real than anything else that I had ever seen or known. My perception of God changed in that instance from my being a skeptic to the assurance that God is a definite and known entity. It was as real as anything that I have ever seen. I felt bathed in this glow and felt warmed....held and loved. Im not sure how long this lasted but slowly the light rescended but the awareness did not. The feeling that I had was the peace that surpasses all understanding. I knew that my son was going to be fine. My chills disappeared and I felt no more worry or anxiety. The doctors continued to check on my son and finally an hour after the light appeared they came in and said we think that hes turned the corner. I felt like they sure got the news on a delayed schedule. For a long time I felt that I was having some stress response to my sons health crisis but the knowing has never receded. Ive ever since referred to this as my near death experience by proxy. My son improved and was released from the hospital several days later. That event still is vivid and real in my mind like it happened yesterday. The awareness and belief from that experience has continued on to this day.

1372,OBE,1229,44,,M,"Almost immediately after taking the divine plant I began to fall out of my body. It was a wholly new sensation for me. After years of pursuing the actual out of body occurrence it was nothing as I had imagined it to be. There is noting that can compare one for the actual sensation. During numerous mediations I had always imagined myself rising above my body to look down and view myself. But this is not what actually happened. I actually fell into myself. I literally fell out of myself and by falling inside myself. And then instantly found myself floating above my body laying on the bed. The experience of being pulled out of the body was not an unpleasant sensation rather it was the first time to feel it and all firsts are usually associated with some fear. In this case it happened so fast and the train I was on had no exit routes, so I was on it for the duration. Once I was above my body the experience was quite pleasant. I was amazed at how I looked. I also notice the family cat was aware of my presence which I found quite interesting as it gazed upon my astral body. Just as I was becoming acquainted with my new surroundings I was yanked yet again in another direction at an astounding rate through a tunnel towards a light. Upon reaching the end of the tunnel I seemed to be deposited on the other side of a threshold. This place was completely and utterly spectacular. I was suddenly connected to everything was the feeling I remember most. I only needed to think of something and the associated response was with me. The communication was so much different here. I wasnt thinking in words but pictures associated with strong feelings and emotions. And I was like a newborn. I had very little experience in this new environment. It was very much a fish out of water experience. The thing that left the most lasting impression on me was this. I was able to look back on where I had just come from. The physical world. It was close. I could perceive it clearly as if it were a separate dimension but very close. I began to focus on the edges of it as it didnt seem to be wholly formed yet. The colors were so vibrant and alive.  So organic. The edges looked like caviar. And It came into me that I was perceiving the physical on a molecular level. I was so amazed. Then suddenly it came through me like a lightening bolt. These molecules perceived me. They were aware I was looking at them. Communication!! Images and information passed at an alarming rate. I was aware of the rythme and reason for everything coming into being. It filled me with a sense of joy I had never felt before. I laughed. I knew what life really was. These small bits of life....molecules...all formed based on collective thoughts. We all were creating everyday. We just didnt realize how powerful our thoughts we were. Then I was aware of a presence behind me. It was so brite and so large. My first thoughts were not of intrigue but of how small and dim I was. And just this tiny bit of hesitation flooded me with thoughts of....had I killed myself. Suddenly I was flooded with thoughts of fear. I wanted to know if I was alive. I yearned to feel my body again. So I prayed to feel my body again. And I was propelled in that direction. It was not an easy maneuver. It took some time to anchor myself in my body but it was accomplished. I had set up a timer on the side of the night stand. Total duration was 15 minutes. It had felt like an eternity. There was actually no sensation of time where I had gone. It did not exist.

1383,NDE,1117,30,,M,"I was walking along a road. It was not paved, but a gravel path, very nicely maintained with beautiful flowers along the sides. The road started in a valley and went up a hill towards a very beautiful mansion or palace with a gate in front of it. It was far off in the distance from where I began to walk, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say how far exactly. On either side of the road, the land sloped away sharply, like going off a cliff, so if one fell off the road, one would land in a deep, dark pit. From the pit one could hear sounds of agony, wailing, and lamenting from human beings who were down there. Some tried to claw their way up and grab at me on the road, but I knew they could not actually reach me. I was a little afraid at first, as I knew this to be the pit of hell. The road was not narrow, however, so there was no danger of me falling off the road. I began walking towards the gate, all the while the lost souls wailing until I got near to the gate. Close to the gate, they were no longer around. The mansion was very beautiful. The whole environment was other-worldly, somehow glittering and radiant. I knew I was on another plane, no longer on Earth. I could hear the gentle music of stringed instruments in the background, very soothing and lovely. Eventually I started nearing the gate of the mansion or palace. The mansion was actually quite far from the gate, but one could see radiant beings behind the gate going about their daily activities. Some were carrying baskets with flowers and all were going about their daily routine. There was complete unity and love there, unlike the way people on Earth behave. It was serene and peaceful, just a wonderful place, and I really wanted so much to go inside. There were four winged angels guarding the gate on the outside, two on each side, and as I approached, they moved together and crossed their arms, blocking my entry. They were radiant beings, clearly not human. They were so very kind, but were not going to let me in, although they did not say anything to that effect. There was so much joy and peace there, I tried to get by them, when a group of beings from inside approached the gate to talk to me. An elderly \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d (not a human being) with white hair spoke to me. Although he was right in front of me, his voice sounded like he was very, very far away. It was almost like I was hearing an echo of something said in the distance. He said I would be there at a point in time, but not yet, that my mission was incomplete and that I still had a lot more to accomplish. He was very kind and spoke gently to me, absolutely convincing me that I could not get in. Until this moment, I had really not thought about anything relating to my earthly life, although I knew who I was. I was dressed as I was the day of the accident. When he told me that I could not enter, only then did I start to try to think about what had really happened to me and what was going on. I thought it odd that I was the only person around and there were no dogs or other animals. As I was considering all this, I left that place. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I actually regained consciousness at that precise moment, but I suspect I did. I did not recognize any people whom I knew previously who had died.

1387,DEE,1158,9,,M,"As the night passed I would fall into and out of sleep, waking when I became cold with chills or hot from the fever. At one point during the night I had awoken again from the fever and at that time I became more aware that my illness was worse, much worse than my parents had originally thought. I definitely dont believe my parents were aware of just how ill I was because had they know they would have taken me to a doctor. At this point when I awoke from the fever I was delirious again and wanted to get up and wake my parents to tell them how sick I was but I didnt have the strength to get up or yell for them. I was very distressed by this time as I just intuitively knew I was very ill and I needed help, but was helpless as I could not speak let alone get up to tell my parents. Just as I thought my fever couldnt get any worse and as I laid helpless in my bed a white-golden light started to appear to my left and I turned my eyes to see this white-golden light begin to form against the wall. This white-golden light began to take shape until it became three separate beings, all bathed in the white-golden light they formed from, a white-golden light that seemed to dance all around them. They did not speak, they did not look directly at me, but instead they stood silently with heads bowed. I do remember they were all dressed in what I can only describe as a monks robe, with the hood and large sleeves. As soon as I saw the beings of light I immediately began to feel better, I no longer felt feverish, my aches stopped and my strength was coming back. Prior to that moment I was feeling the worse I had all night and my fever and delirium still had a grip on me, yet the moment I began to see the beings forming my fever dissipated and the delirium went away. Once the beings were fully formed my thinking was completely clear again, no delirium and my fever and aches were gone. The overwhelming feeling of complete serenity, peace and calm came over me, I was not afraid of the beings in the least and instinctively knew they were there for me, then just as suddenly as the golden beings of light had appeared they faded away.

1390,ME ,1108,19,,F,"I was just riding the subway when, out of nowhere, Jesus appeared to me. It wasnt a visual appearance, but sort of in my minds eye, yet his presence was an absolute certainty to me and I could sense him very, very powerfully. He appeared to me as he is so often depicted in European paintings, with a flowing robe, long hair, and a beard but other than that he was in a place that was entirely dark. In other words, I just saw Jesus who was otherwise surrounded by blackness he was all that mattered at that moment. He spoke only once and asked a single question which I will never forget as long I as draw breathe. He asked me, Do you want me to show you how I love you? One would think that his appearance would have surprised me, but I just took it in stride and thought to myself, sure, what the heck, what have I got to lose? I was curious, so I immediately agreed, but I never said yes aloud, but somehow communicated directly and immediately. Jesus, whose arms had been at his side, wordlessly just opened his arms wide open and instantly something happened to me. Now, there are no human words to describe what I felt next. I had the sense of absolutely pure love being poured all over me from above, sort of like being baptized with pure love. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before it was not at all HUMAN love, but far more. There was no ulterior motive, no expectation, no string attached, just pure, altruistic, unadulterated love. I immediately started to just cry and I leaned my arm on the seat in front of me and hid my face so nobody could see me crying like that. (It was Christmas Day and the train was almost completely empty. The closest person to me was half a train car away from me.) The sensation was ineffable and I felt like the luckiest human being who had ever lived. I started asking Jesus questions like, Why are you showing this to me, Im unworthy, I dont deserve it. I repeated, There are people who have been religious all their lives and havent experienced this, they deserve it, not me. Things went on like this for some time, I have no idea how long. I can only say that the total ride time from where I got on to where I exited the train was about 50 minutes and the event did not start right away, but perhaps half-way through the journey. The love just kept flowing over me, but no answer to my questions came. At times, the love pouring over me and enveloping me seemed like water flowing, at another moment, it seemed like gold coins being poured over me and it just didnt end. Gradually, I stopped crying and stopped asking questions, I just relished it and continued to feel so very luck.  Eventually, I got off the train at my station. Im not sure how long I waited for my bus or if I even waited at all. The blissful state of being divinely loved took center stage and nothing else mattered at all to me. The bus took off and I started to cry again, again hiding from others. I re-asked my questions, but still no answers. Details of the bus ride are a little unclear, but I remember there was music, too. It started early in the experience and it was as if Jesus were singing a particular song to me, one that I had liked, but not thought much about. It was a popular song from the late 60s sung by Petula Clark called My Love is Warmer than the Sunshine. It was repeating constantly in my mind, as if it were Jesus trying to find an analogy that would resonate with me. Ive copied the lyrics that just kept repeating in my mind. As I heard them sung with Petulas voice, but Jesus intentions, I thought deeply about each line and could really FEEL it somehow. They were no longer just silly lyrics from a pop song, but felt experiences of the most profound type. My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine, softer than a sigh. My love is deeper than the deepest ocean, wider than the sky. My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above. And there is nothing in this world that can ever change my love. I know the ride to my friends house took about 25 minutes, although I had no real sense of time during this event. At some point during the ride or shortly after I got off the bus and starting walking towards her place I began to wonder if the event was going to stop and, if it didnt, what I would do, how could I visit with my friend. It wasnt a terrible worry, it just occurred to me that I just couldnt function normally with what was happening to me. This is where the plot thickens. I began the walk to my friends home. It had snowed and there were icicles hanging from the trees. In my love-enveloped state, I began to look at world and it was not as I had ever seen it before. Somehow, I had the feeling that Jesus was showing me how he saw the world, but that was a guess, he wasnt talking.

1391,SDE,1277,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

1392,PLR,1199,37,,M,"When I looked at the map, it took me to India. Now, it is important to know that I had NEVER studied anything about India or its culture up to this point, even though I have always cooked with their spices, been attracted to their clothing, and always felt drawn to learning Ayurveda.  On the map of India, it drew me to an area called Gujarat (again, I had never heard of this place, but when I googled it, it was exactly where I was shown on the map). Making things more interesting, one of my spirit guides is named Ajwa, and there are streets and parks in Gujarat named Ajwa.  The next thing I knew, I was mentally whisked to a beautiful area, and to a house where I lived with my mother and father. At first it was nice and peaceful and I felt at home. I was female and in brightly colored clothes that I loved. I remember the area was so green and lush. My mother and father there were my brother and wife in this life. This was the mid 1800s, and the British military were there.  They came in the night and took my mother away to rape and kill her. I remember the panic I felt knowing I would never see her again. What is really interesting is that prior to this event, I was always terrified of my wife getting kidnapped and killed. Since this event, I have no fear because I know it is left over from India. Anyway, the English soldiers came back the next day and burned our village. I was raped and my nipples cut off. I remember being held down in one of the buildings, like a stable, as others looked on. Interestingly, I have a birthmark under one of my nipples, and I have always hated having them touched. I was then killed...

1393,ME ,1462,23,,M,"Floating in an erect and body as light air: As I was walking, I became aware of a strangely subtle force coming over me. I felt a kind of vibration starting to run up through my body. It was soft at first, then became more pronounced as time went on. I felt the top of my head being pulled straight up while at the same time, my hips were being pulled downward into the earth. It felt as though I was being supported by a bolt of energy that literally ran through my body. The energy expanded from above me and from down below at the same time. My posture became very straight and It felt as though I was floating and weightless within it. I was surprised at how effortless it was to be so light and erect. It reminded me of the description a Tai Chi teacher once gave me of how to stand correctly, as if heaven were pulling me upwards by the top of my head and earth pulling me downwards from somewhere near the prostrate.  Effortless Breathing  Breathing became deep, light and effortless. I found myself witnessing each breath without the experience of guilt or anxiety resisting each in or exhale. All the usual tension in my solar plexus, tightness in my diagram and tension in my lungs had vanished. Breathing became a brand new experience for me, where I was able to take very satisfying and refreshing breaths.I marveled at what was happening to me, It felt wonderful to feel so free and light on the earth in my body. After time it occurred to me that this experience surely couldnt last very long because it felt so wonderful. I waited a while to see if it would leave. I waited for the familiar tension, anxiety, the heaviness of the body and breath to return. After a very short time, I let go and allowed the wonderful experience to guide me. Where did the mind go? As I surrendered more to the experience I became aware that thoughts werent being created on the fly, I had them, but I was creating them when needed and by choice, by powerful choice, they werent free floating and coming out of no where and they certainly werent attacking me. It was like the experiences of floating lightly within my body that had a very erect posture or breathing unburdened by guilt, anxiety, depression, anger, self hatred, self judgement. Now I was experiencing emptiness where 100s of thoughts per seconds should have been. The triad of experiences was connected together and created a sense of great joy, understanding and freedom. Freeing because I had always known myself to be what my thoughts told me I was, and here, those thoughts not existing at all, it was a beautiful realization that I still lived on without them. With the mind being opaque, its opinions laid to rest, the veil of ignorance lifted and laid bare, the truth stood squarely in my face, It was awe inspiring it was beautiful, it was more than joyful. There was no doubt about It. It became clear to me that the mind was not all powerful, all knowing or omnipotent, but rather a mirage that wasnt there when looked at from the side of truth. The truth not only showed what the I was part of, bliss, freedom, love, oneness with all, but at the same time, what I have never been; body, guilty and deserving of punishment, hatred, shame, terror and death. The mind was impotent and could not stand its ground when directly facing the truth. Experiencing truth was the most joyous, romantic and blissful experience. I was free from the slavery of illusion, free to experience the reality of my being, free to love and be loved solely because I was.  How could my past vanish without sins being accounted for? I pondered the implications of how such a ferociously powerful mind grasping into every part of my being every second of my life could have been tossed aside into non existence so matter of faculty.

He was beckoning me to follow and I was above beautiful pastures and then higher above a mountain with waterfalls, and it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I felt total joy, enthusiasm, peace, love, and I remember thinking, take me, I need this too, why cant I go too?

When I was aware that I was back in the room, I was in shock from what had just happened, but the room was filled with a golden warm moving stream of light, that was fading. I started yelling to my friend who was sobbing in horrific grief, that he was in the light, cant you see the light?

1395,DEE,1299,22,,M,"I entered my bedroom, sat down on a cushioned window seat, and the sobbing continued. Moments later, I felt a tingling in my arms, kind of like they had fallen asleep, though I wasnt sitting in a way that impaired blood flow. Moments later, my arms rose from my sides and my hands literally came together in prayer in front of my chest. I watched in complete wonderment as this occurred. And I suddenly felt in my heart a very clear instruction that I needed to get on my knees and pray. But I was refused. I didnt understand why prayer was necessary. In fact, it seemed like an act of subservience that made me uneasy. Meanwhile, my arms and hands were literally vibrating, and my hands were stuck together that literally, I was unable to pull them apart. Why is this happening to me, I wondered. And I suddenly understood that I was dying. No sooner did that thought cross my mind, my hands fell back to my sides--thus making a connection in my mind between the thought I was dying and the release of my hands from the unseen force, and the immediate cessation of the tingling sensations. Given how strange this all was, it seemed perfectly logical to me that I was indeed dying. My mother was spiritual, so I thought I better go downstairs and tell her. In the living room, I sat beside my mother and told her what had just happened. She told me to go ahead and pray. I told her I couldnt, and that I was dying. She was very spiritual. When she heard this, she thought perhaps a part of me was dying, to make room for something else... but I wasnt physically dying. I told her she was wrong. She checked my temperature. I had a fever of 103. She went to get some aspirin, and told me to to relax. After I took the aspirin, I lay down on the living room couch, and thats when a spiritual being showed up. I heard him as clear as day, talking in my head, just as if he was in the room with me. The first thing he said to me was, Ok, lets go! When he said that, I could feel a pulling sensation all of a sudden on the region of my solar plexus. If the soul was real, it felt like he was reaching in and pulling my soul out of my body. It was a very uncomfortable and unusual feeling, and I reacted to it by kicking my feet on the couch. When I did this, the pulling, or suction-y feeling stopped. Long story short, this fight to stay went on for more than an hour. I remained lucid throughout the whole experience, conversing with my family while also telepathically conversing with this Being. The longer I resisted, the more this Being resorted to threatening me. I didnt care--no matter what the threats (Stay and youll be crazy, no one will ever understand you, your family wont remember a thing--their memories will be wiped) I refused to go wherever it was this Being was intent on taking me. Finally, fed up with my refusal, the Being told me he wasnt leaving empty handed. If I didnt come then and there, he would cause my father to have a massive heart attack, and he would take my father. My father and I had had a long and stormy relationship, however, I didnt have to think about that threat. I immediately relented and agreed to come. But I asked to say goodbye to my family first--which he permitted. I literally kissed and hugged everyone who was there and said goodbye. It was the saddest moment I have ever experienced. Then I told the Being I was finally ready, and I heard a voice (a different voice than the Being) tell me it wasnt my time. For a while I pleaded to go. I was ready. But it was no use. My fever broke, and I felt better than I had ever felt in my life-- and I appreciated my life like I had never appreciated it before.

1396,DEE,1177,43,,F,"After hanging up the phone with my younger sister, I said out loud that as a family we could not endure another experience with cancer. My father had died of a glioblastoma at age 54 in 1978. I prayed with concern over my sisters initial test results and began to cry uncontrollably. Very suddenly, I began to feel an exceptionally warm energy burning beneath my stomach but above my abdomen. This warm energy began slowly traveling up through the center of my body. By the time it entered my head, I had received knowledge that my sisters test results would turn out to show a benign condition. I cant describe how I knew this, but I was 100% certain that that would be the outcome and I had received this knowledge from some knowing entity. At the same time this was happening to me, my cat in the hallway started showing very peculiar behavior. He was standing on 3 legs with one of his front legs in the air a position Ive never seen a cat take. In addition, he seemed to be in a trance. When I called his name, he could not hear me. His head was moving slowly from side to side, left to right, like he was transfixed by some image. I looked in the direction of his gaze and saw nothing but darkness. He stayed in this position with these movements for several minutes in a trance-like state. After this was all over for him and me, I phoned my sister back and told her of my experience and told her she had absolutely nothing to worry about concerning the tests she was to take the next day and that I was phoning her now so the next day when she had the tests she would have proof of the truthfulness of my experience.

I have had experience with psychedelics before in the past but never experienced anything close to what happened next. I sat in a circular cozy sofa and closed my eyes and my consciousness entered a dimension where it felt as if I had tapped into an eternal network of knowledge.

An understanding of love was undeniable as it clearly is the adhesive force binding all of life. I understood that life requires a balance of the extremes and that death is nothing to fear but simply the critical point where our spirits transcend the physical realm.

1411,NDE,1276,45,,M,"My first memories was a sense of unnatural sounds like the building itself was breathing or living somehow. I saw through the walls to a room that I knew was on another dimension or in a spiritual plane. In this room, men sat and leaned against the walls while they waited. I knew somehow that they were waiting to escort the dead to another place. I knew that I was close to death in this moment and that was the reason I could see them. I was not afraid. I just knew it.  My next memory was of a village setting that looked medieval or European. The streets were cobble stone and the buildings were stone as well. People walked in groups down the road. I think a better description would be that they wondered aimlessly. They looked straight ahead, slightly downward and seemed to be without hope. I had an overwhelming feeling of gloom in this place and I felt as though they were being punished or detained in some way.  The thing that was MOST striking about these visions was there absolute vividness. It was as though I was seeing them with the most high definition TV ever seen. I could not explain how powerful this sense of visual clarity was. It was as though it were more real than real life. Even though these people seemed as though they were not supposed to look at me, occasionally one would lock eyes with me for just a moment. They had such despair in their eyes that it saddened me to make eye contact.  Later I was in this same place in a large arena, though that is not really the right word. It was a place in a large building that had a circular path that came in one door and passed in front of what seemed to be stadium type seating.  I had a feeling that people were paraded through this place in the lines I had seen them walking in on the streets to possibly be judged or reviewed in some way. Again, the architecture was like nothing I have seen here in the states. It seemed very old and mostly made from stone.  My next and final memory was my defining moment where I was like a speck dust floating in a space that felt like a large room. I was exactly like those particles of dust that you see floating randomly in the open space of a room as the sunlight passes through a window. I was free, floating on an invisible river of air through this space, around a tree or plant, feeling sheer joy and amazement. I had no identity in these moments. I had no memory of anything personal or earthly. I only knew that I was truly at peace. I was one with the universe, completely accepted, and loved. I felt such joy in those brief moments that it makes my heart race even now as I recall it. As I passed through this space, I saw a very obvious ray of what I thought was sunshine coming downward from the right from no obvious window or light source. I didnt question anything, but I remember a sense of really hoping that I would drift through this light. As I did enter the light, I felt happiness like I have never known. I felt as though anything I had known before this moment was infantile and insignificant. I knew this was the presence of God, though I did not see a face. I dont even know that I had the ability to look at the source of the light. I just basked in its glory.  I saw flashes or arcs of light zipping above me. They looked like just that really, but I felt like they were something bigger than me, something more than I could even try to understand. Later, I remembered seeing a phenomenon called flying rods that I have seen myself in videos that I have where these things that are not visible to the naked eye show up on high speed video and they appear to swim through the sky with multiple wings on a straight translucent body.  I wonder if these could be what I saw in this place. As far as I know this phenomenon is not explained scientifically yet, but you can find hundreds or thousands of video accounts on youtube by searching for flying rods. I may be nothing, but then again...  I had a number of very substantial things that became known to me in this place. For one, the reason that everyone describes these visions as being so vivid is that we are not looking at them with our failing human eyes. We are seeing them in a supernatural state of being where our tired old eyeballs could not even begin to compare. Also, I became acutely aware that I am a being inside of a being. I felt that I am a spirit aside from the conscious brain thought, which I always thought was ME. Suddenly, I had all of these memories of things like driving on long trips when I am complete zoned out in deep thought, yet somehow my body is driving the car, slowing and speeding up in traffic, using turn signals, and yet I arrive 30 miles later not remembering the drive. It occurred to me that there is a watcher within us that is the true us who is ready to take the wheel at any moment if we zone out, so to s",,US Citize,"50,000",religious,spiritual,Unaffilia,Unaffilia,,,weekly,week,very strong,very st,"0 24,999",Some,Compute,,divor,single,Yes,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

1415,ME ,1302,51,,F,"Sometime in 1996, I was sitting alone in my office in my home in the middle of writing my memoir novel. I was sitting in my chair, thinking at the time. Suddenly I saw a vision in my head that Im entitling Our Human Timeline of Existence. It was a horizontally long image running left to right in my head. There were no words, numbers or sounds, only images. At the left of this horizontal Timeline was the first image. That image was of an ape down on all fours and facing left. To the right of that ape and facing right was a second ape starting to stand up. To the right of that ape and facing right was the third ape, looking Neanderthal. To the right of that ape was a picture of a human being facing right. Then there was a little space. To the right of the space was the image of Leonardo da Vinci\xe2\x80\x99s Vitruvian Man. To the right of that was a very, very long empty area. At the right end of the Timeline, the last image, is a great gust of horizontal wind blurring out the whole right end of the Timeline. That was what I saw. There were no dates on this Timeline. I thought about that vision and why I was seeing it. According to the spacing of the images one to another on the left and then the very long empty space in the middle area and then the wind blur all the way on the right, the vision said to me that, according to where Vitruvian Man was standing in the Timeline, we humans are currently (the 20th Century) into about 20% of our survival, from our beginnings on Earth to our end. I couldnt see our end because that was where the horizontal wind blur was, which took up all the space on the right side. There were no dates, so I dont know how it would happen to us, when, or if it would even happen at all. What I do see is that we humans have many, many more millenniums of survival. I believe I saw this vision and I believe (kinda) in what it was telling me. I wasnt sure what I was supposed to do with this knowledge except to tell people. But since that was one of my first spiritual experiences, I was so new to God (but still an atheist), that I think I told one other person. I wasnt confident in what I saw and I didnt want people to think I was crazy. Im uploading a file of the picture I drew of this vision. I dont remember what day I actually saw it because I wasnt writing down my spiritual experiences yet. So I recorded my vision in this picture at a later time, June 19, 2006.

1419,DEE,1234,24,,M,"Introduction While I read through \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven\xe2\x80\x9d I was struck by the similarity of several distinct items that were present within a spiritual experience that occurred to me. The items that Dr. Eben Alexander presented in \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven that were similar if not identical to what I experienced are as follows: 1.) Peoples clothes were natural to the environment. 2.) The experiences were perceived to be magnitudes more real than normal life. 3.) The \xe2\x80\x9cglorious chant\xe2\x80\x9d was everywhere and came from many places. 4.) A exhilarating sense of unity with all that exists. 5.) Dr. Eben Alexanders description of communication as, \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts that entered me directly\xe2\x80\x9d is similar to the direct communication with the Word of God that came upon me. The Word communicated as if through every subatomic particle field--not through words but through the Word of God. Although the religious experience written here is in dream format, the information transferred and situations experienced were of a supra consciousness nature. The religious experience developed as an independent psychological process over a twenty year period--from adolescence to adulthood. The religious experience happened to me at age 24 on September 03, 1979. I am 57 years old. Since I was 24 years old I have had no extraordinary psychological experiences. Personal experiences with direct spiritual development of consciousness are eternal and transcend both living experiences and after death experiences. Heaven is not strictly an after death state and something, perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic mind,\xe2\x80\x9d interacts with the human brain and shares some obscure affinity with each human mind. In a sense \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d is omnipresent; heaven is all around us but we typically fail to see it. Both living and after death experiences attest to this fact. This experience is of the living variety.  The Trances From age 4 through 21 I had experienced approximately 10 trances that would take me to what seemed like another dimension. My first recollection, of two symbols that appeared in one form or another throughout the trances and in the religious experience, was from a time as a kid with high fever. I saw two sparkling nuns that were walking along an infinite seashore. Children were playing beneath a sun umbrella and fragile autumn leaves blew across the sand. I perceived an infinitely dense black line coming from the sky to crush the leaves, the sun umbrella and the children. I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe line. the line\xe2\x80\x9d as my mother put cold water and rubbing alcohol on my forehead to reduce the fever. The trances stopped occurring during fever (associated with illness) around 10 years old. But I would try to stay awake by watching T.V. late into the night because I knew the trance would take place if I fell asleep and that scared me. Usually when the trance started Id get up out of bed and sit in a chair. The experience then caused the world to fade out. The walls of the room would disappear and a dark space with two huge dense masses of sparkling energy would transfer their energy back and forth through a sparkling, connecting line along which the energy flowed. I had no recognition of my presence. When the one mass would become infinitesimal to the point of disappearing, the other would become dense and heavy. Then I would become frightened. But, eventually, the energy would transfer out of the dense and heavy sparkling mass along the line and back into the one that almost disappeared. The last few times, around 20 years old, when I experienced the trances, the episodes were witnessed without fear. Id get up out of bed, sit on a couch and simply watch the show. Afterwords, I thought that was really strange but it didnt make any sense so I didnt think much of it. When I was 24 years old, at a time when my mind was biologically mature, I had a profound religious experience that seemed to be the end result of the trances. It was in the form of a dream that I could understand. Although this experience was in dream-like symbolism. I experienced it far greater than waking life experiences. Perception and emotion while in it had been enhanced. I often referred to an increase of reality to a magnitude of 10 when recounting the experience. Carl Jung stated that what acts is actual and this experience was actually the most intense experience in my life. Like a dream that you try to recall, while it fades away with the more time that passes between waking and the writing of it, much of the details escaped my memory at the time of writing it. I was in tears and quite overwhelmed upon waking but some parts of the dream that I remember and wrote are still remembered along with the emotional intensity as evidenced in my consistent effort",,US Citize,2001 2,spiritual,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,dail,week,very strong,avera,"0 24,999",some,Machini,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult
1420,ME ,1269,59,,F,"(Repeat of #43) I was driving my car alone and running errands during the daytime. It was an ordinary, sunny July day during the week. I was driving past the Briarcliff Congregational Church in Briarcliff Manor, New York, a small, Westchester County suburban community, a one-hour drive north of Manhattan. I glanced over at the churchs directory sign to read it. It said You say theres distance between you and God. Who moved? I immediately stopped my car and held up traffic, stared at those words and thought for a few seconds about that question. I remember answering that question to myself: I moved. It was I who moved because God doesnt move. Hes all around us. I suddenly realized what I was saying and I said to myself: Why am I answering this question? I dont believe in God. Then I started to cry and I was shaking in my car. It was a soft cry and a mild shaking. But I was aware that I was being moved by something. I heard the car horns blaring behind me but ignored them. I knew I had to make an instant decision to stay with this feeling or cut it off, ignore it and continue on with my chores. Although I was a little frightened at the unknown feelings and event that were overtaking me, I decided to stay with my feelings. I pulled across the street into the empty parking lot of the little Briarcliff Public Library and parked in a quiet corner of the lot. I sat crying and shaking and let whatever it was overtake me. I was still a little frightened but I decided to trust the event. I suddenly looked down and saw that my chest was ethereally slowly opening up and a current of wavy air was entering my chest. This did not at all frighten me. I did not hear anything, touch anything or smell anything. (With me, all my visions, signs and visits by Holy Spirit were always visual. I guess since God made me a visual artist, It comes to me in a visual form.) God then played with me a game of spiritual connect the dots. It released from my memory spiritual experiences from my past that I had heretofore forgotten but remembered when they became fresh again in my memory. (Ill be registering each one in separate forms on your site.) I was sitting in my car for about one half hour and in that half hour I went from believing nothing to believing everything. I knew there really was a God. I knew that Jesus was the Son of God. I knew there really was a Holy Spirit. I knew the Bible was true. And I felt that God wanted me to be Christian, so I converted myself from Judaism to Christianity on the spot. No one came over to me while I sat in my car. I was infused with a tremendous new and exciting spiritual energy and couldnt wait to go home and tell Hank, my husband, all about it.

1429,OBE,1133,39,,M,"The night before I had this experience was a very emotional point in my life, the world seemed so terribly unjust and cruel that I was at a breaking point, that evening when arriving home walking from my car to the front door I paused to look up into the star filled sky with tears rolling down my cheeks quietly cried Why, why, why? I could not understand how the complete innocents of this world could be treated so terribly, how children could suffer so unjustly under the hand of others. I cried to sky as the universe because I could not believe in a God and had little faith in anything spiritual, if any.  Since rejecting the belief in God at the age of about 22, I did not believe such a thing could exist, because any such God which would allow these kinds of things to happen wasnt any kind of God to me. I couldnt pray to the concept of God but the universe was real, the immense out there, the all that is was something I could pour out my heart to without needing a belief in God. That night I gave the heavens my full heart seeking an answer to that question, with all my heart tearfully pleading for the answer. The next afternoon I received an answer to that question; since we are all a part of one another we do it to ourselves.  Although the answer didnt completely make up for all of the pain, much of the edge of that pain was taken off by finally being able to understand why such terrible things could happen to others in our world, to simply understand we have the freedom of choice to do such things because in the wider perspective the reality is we are all one and in that hurting no one else other than ourselves. Because of this and this alone we are allowed the freedom to do good or evil, if we werent really one I do not believe the spiritual heart of life would allow such to occur, call that center God, the conscious collective, the collective soul or what ever name you might choose. I finally came to understand, in the end we all pay the price for any wrong as well as reap the reward for any good and this took away much of the anger I had against reality for allowing terrible things to happen to good people.  The following is how the answer came to me through a dream-vision which was the most lucid moment of my life before or since but I must also add the following; the experience and my conclusions from it are my own made from who I am as a individual and how I saw the experience. Was it really God on high I met? I thought it was but beyond my own belief I cannot say it was, perhaps I met a collective soul which was so wonderful to me I thought it was God when in fact God might be levels above, so to speak,.   The Vision: Meeting a Sun-Intelligence-God. Sun of Souls~Souls of Sun; One Spirit~One Life.  Note: This experience was no doubt individually viewed through my own shade of colored glasses, limited to my own ability to understand things at the time, how I needed to be shown who we really are. This may have been brought on by severe apnea, a problem I had where I could stop breathing for long periods of time. I believe I may have stopped breathing for far too long that afternoon and had come close to death producing this NDE-like experience. I dont really know if this was a OOBE or due to apnea, but either way, what ever caused the experience it deeply impacted my outlook on life, what and who we really are.  One warm afternoon in 1996 I took a short nap and unexpectedly awoke within my slumber to find myself in a vast void in the presence of a huge sun or sphere of light, quickly coming to the understanding that this sun was pure conscious awareness. I was completely surprised to find myself so fully conscious in this empty but light-filled void which I knew to be more real than waking reality, in this place feeling super-conscious beyond anything I had experienced before. Although the light was without any kind of visual hint of facial features, I strongly sensed it smiling nothing but love for me and through those feelings knowing an unseen face.  While in the presence of this light I immediately and fully felt it peering deeply into my own awareness, lovingly knowing everything about me all at once.

I say feeling isnt the right word because it implies emotion. What I experienced was not of any of the five senses. It was the best feeling I have ever had and can only say it was a spiritual experience of perfection.

Once alert, I noticed an older truck in my direct view. It was an odd, faded color of purple. As the color caught my attention, the truck hummed to life. A man had started the motor and was backing up.  Behind the truck, sitting in the driveway playing, was a small child aged 2-3. Horrified, I watched as the truck backed over the little child. Intuitively I knew it was the boys father who had unknowingly run over, and killed the child.  Immediately the infant boys essense popped out of his body. There was a translucent quality to it, but for me it was more of a strong sensing of his presence. He was bewildered, and unsure of what to do. Disoriented.  Having had an NDE some seven years prior, I knew that I was there to lead this little one to the Light. I mentally asked him if I could help, and he agrred. Following my lead, we drifted toward a pinpoint of Light in the far distance. He calmed significantly and headed on toward the Light. I melded back into my body and became physically alert again.

1442,OBE,1392,22,,M,"This story is an account of an amazing venture into the future that came about by what I, years later, came to know as a Near Death Experience. Although I wasnt physically near death at the time, I experienced all the earmarks of a classic Near Death Experience, including leaving my physical body and traveling at tremendous speeds through a variety of mystical dimensions.   A Window in Time By Joe   The cold March rain dripped steadily off the back porch awning as I ran water for my morning coffee. Through the kitchen window I could see streaks of snow across the muddy back yard. Where the yard ended and the dark gray bark of maple trees along the hillside took over, the snow still covered all the land. The phone rang. Setting down the coffee pot, I reached for the phone. Hello. I said. You wanna meet for lunch? Jim asked without even bothering to say hello. Sure, I replied. Anything to get me out and away from the boredom. We exchanged a few more words and hung up. I put the coffee pot on the stove, grabbed a quick shower, put on a sweatshirt, poured myself a cup of coffee, and sat down to read a couple chapters from an Eric Von Daniken book I had just picked up the day before. A couple hours later, I put on a rainproof windbreaker and headed for town. When I arrived at Charlies Lounge, Jim was already there. Whats the special?, I asked the bartender.  Burger and fries, he said. Good enough for me, I replied. Put some cheese on it too. Jim looked over and smiled. You wanna beer? Ah, its a little early for that I said. Come on, one with lunch wont hurt you. he said. Get him a draught, he said to the bartender. Jim was a road construction worker who hadnt been working for the past couple weeks due to the incessant rain. Id known him since we were kids. His boredom wasnt as intense as mine, but the cold, dreary rain was getting a lot of people down in this tiny Pennsylvania railroad town. It was a tough little town along the edge of the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania. The heart of Appalachia was just a few minutes away. The Vietnam War was just winding down and Watergate was front page news every day. Life, like the weather, was bleak. A month earlier I had finished a two year stint as a Military Policeman in Germany.  I was accustomed to the excitement of constant stimulation. As a policeman I had weathered the drama and tragedy of the Munich Olympics, witnessed first hand the violence of the militant Baader-Meinhof Gang, and while wearing the white hat of law enforcement, had been front and center in the unpredictable and dangerous world of heroin addiction. Okay, Ill sip on a beer, I said to the bartender. Jim smiled. When I looked in his direction I could see a couple guys playing a game of pool. Immediately my radar went off. Two brothers were playing a game of eightball. One of the brothers was a year older than me, and had been a superb football player. The other brother was a year younger than me and had always been a bit of a troublemaker. And, he was drunk! It just past noon and he was drunker than a skunk. Several years earlier, I had been in an all out fight with the younger one. I had knocked him down and was on top of him, pounding the living daylights out of him when someone pulled me off.  Here he was again. Drunk, and this time with his older brother, who it appeared he was going to try and impress. He was staring at me. His face was getting red. I could feel my adrenalin surging. Every drop of testosterone in my body was lit up. The two years in the military had added 30 pounds of muscle to my body. I had been trained in judo and self defense techniques. I was capable of putting anyone into submission in seconds. I was ready! To avoid initiating any confrontation and to maintain my focus, I chose to gaze at the cue ball(the all white pool ball) as it bounded around the pool table. A moment went by, then two. I kept my focus on the cue ball. I began developing a slightly different mind set. I clearly remembering saying to myself, I choose to not allow my emotions to dictate my actions. I choose to just stay focused on the neutral cue ball. Then BOOM, it happened. Suddenly, without warning, my entire state of consciousness shot directly out of the top of my head. Everything I knew to be me was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and accelerating by the second. At first I seemed to have shot through a tunnel like zone, then into a brightly lit world. I went past cities, land masses, continents, entire worlds. and universes. I clearly remember seeing a great River. I remember thinking at the time that it must be the River that St John spoke of in Revelations. I remember clearly because, at the time, I was a dyed in the wool atheist. But I didnt stop there. I just zipped on by.

1448,DEE,1261,24,,F,"Earlier in the evening, I was very lonely as my new husband was gone a lot. I had only been married about 6 months, and I was beginning to realize that perhaps I had made a mistake marrying this man...that he wasnt all that in love with me. A few days earlier, I had said a prayer and asked if this was all there was to marriage and asked for help from God even though I want sure if there really was a God.  A few days later, I was asleep next to my husband. And I felt like I was having a dream with this bright light appearing. It was the brightest light I had ever seen...almost a piercing blue white light. I opened my eyes and realized this was not a dream at all! I looked into my closest where the doors were open and out of the left back side of the closest, the light radiated from. I wasnt scared...actually it was quite comforting. I quickly woke my husband up. He couldnt believe what he was seeing either. I kept saying, what is it? Is this real or are we imaging it. We both just sat there for about a minute staring at the light. Again, it was the brightest light I had ever seen but, the light didnt radiate throughout the room but stayed concentrated in the closest. After it disappeared, I just continued to sit up in bed trying to figure out what had just happened. Then, out of the blue, I began speaking in a language that I had never heard. My husband heard me, and thought I was going crazy. I had no idea what was happening. It wasnt scary....just really weird. This continued non stop for about 3 hours until I was completely exhausted and went to sleep at about 6am that am. When I woke up, I was completely perplexed as to what just happened to me. I decided I needed to go talk to someone about this so I went and visited with my priest at the Episcopal church at the time. He tried to explain it but, I was still perplexed as I had never heard of speaking I tongues, nor had I asked to have that given to me.

1453,ME ,1009,18,,F,"One of the weirdest things about this experience was the feeling of getting shot in the head. Actually, I didnt feel a thing, but I remember how my vision exploded in red. I remember how I vaguely felt my body hitting the ground and being unable to stop it, even as I, as a spirit, got yanked out of my body. I didnt feel a bit of pain, and Im usually very scared of blood, but I wasnt scared of the blood I saw coming out of me as I died--just intrigued, but not emotionally connected to it. As a spirit, I learned that I look very different than how I look physically. This experience taught me that I, Theresa, am actually a combination of three women who I was in other lifetimes--and I learned that we dont have to live our lifetimes in chronological order, and those lifetimes can overlap on each other, too. I learned that I, Theresa, am a combination of these three women:-a German Jewish girl who was about sixteen when she died in one of the concentration camps during the Holocaust-an American (Caucasian) woman who was in her 30s when she died in the 1980s-a Caucasian woman with shoulder-length, flaming red hair who was the captain of a starship and had died in the 2300s or thereabouts. She was in her late 20s-early 30s. Id lived all three of these lifetimes before this one. I learned that I, Theresa, am a composite of all three of these women. Im not exactly my own person. Im unique, yes--but I was created from these three women. Looking back on whats happened in the 2000s in our physical world, Im astounded that I basically saw our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan several years before they happened. Back in 1998, it was a lot easier to dismiss this experience as some really vivid dream, emphasis on dream. When I was 18, I couldnt fathom circumstances when the US would choose to wage war against anyone else. It was really easy to dismiss this aspect of my experience as something out of an action movie, perhaps. And I distinctly felt what the other soldiers were feeling--this grief over the fact that they knew, at the time of their deaths, that they would be dying so far away from home for a pointless war. The soldiers in my dream knew this full well as they died. They were extremely sad about this. If I had to describe it, it was like they had this immense, low, wailing grief--something very heavy and sad, like low, gray storm clouds. Back in 1998, one of the things that really amazed me was that the littlest promises we make are, indeed, kept. To go back to this brother of mine: We were fans of James Camerons movie, TITANIC, and we met in an email mailing list. We ended up talking a lot via IM. I dont think we ever exchanged pictures, even. But he was the first to say that he felt like I was his little sister, which was odd because he is an only child, like me. He liked calling me Sis a lot, and I called him big bro, although I dont think I felt this sibling bond quite as strongly as he did. We did talk about the supernatural, and about life beyond death. He talked about being in the US Army for some period of time. I dont know how our conversations got to this point, but we made a promise to each other: that if it really was true that there was life beyond death, whoever would die first would go to the other person and be there for them when it was their time to die. In the case of my experience, I died first and, as promised, I visited him--even if I, at least, had completely forgotten about making this promise in the first place.

1459,ME ,1301,40,,M,"March 1991 had a Thursday fall on the 21st and 28th, and the next Thursday was April 4th. The significance of these dates to me is that one of them was likely the day that I was invested with a powerful message in which the reign of God was revealed to me in no uncertain terms, within the fabric of a pointed admonition. The message came when I was awake. It came in the form of receiving the feelings of other people, to be exact, feeling the feelings of the hospital patients of the Lyons, NJ, VA Hospital. I had recently tried to volunteer at the Lyons VA, but had become discouraged after an incident in which I had been trapped outside in freezing weather with a nursing home patient who could not make it up the stairs to enter the VA clinic I was taking him to. The nursing home was a separate building from the main ring comprising the hospital, and buses shuttled the patients between them. When this patient could not get up the stairs I sat him on a bench outside, went inside, and called security because it was 22 degrees and blowing. The security guys tried very hard to find fault with my actions. I resented the accusations, and frankly, was not thrilled with my job, which essentially duplicated the \xe2\x80\x9cred shirts\xe2\x80\x9d job as a helper for the nurses. I wanted more patient interaction. I decided to stop volunteering. I was in alone that morning in my hot tub not far from the hospital, in Basking Ridge, NJ. It was probably a Thursday because I generally took Thursday off work, even back then. I remember having a sudden fleeting thought that it was a shame how the VA volunteer attempt had turned out. It was sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cno good deed goes unpunished\xe2\x80\x9d thought. I felt what people describe as the \xe2\x80\x9cdoor open\xe2\x80\x9d in my consciousness, in my head. I can only describe it as an odd sensation. And then poured forth into my consciousness were the feelings of all the patients in the hospital, at that time probably 800 souls. The feelings were anger, helplessness, desperation, fear, and loneliness, and probably more, but these were feelings showing the needs of the people who had them. They hit me like a ton of bricks. I was stunned. I have never felt anything so intensely before or since. The feelings lasted only a few seconds, I think, not long at any rate, and were gone. This experience, this message, which had many aspects, was beautiful, was efficient, and was obviously purposeful. I knew instantly what the feelings were, whose, and who had sent them. They were meant to tell me I had made a mistake. They were meant to tell me to go back and try again. They were meant to tell me that God loves those patients, and that He loves me. It was adapted to and respectful of my situation, which is that I am in an interfaith marriage with a non-Christian. It showed me that God lives outside of time and space as we know it, which explains a lot. In short, it was the greatest gift I have received from God, with the possible exception of my wife, whom I suspect was steered to me by Him. I was quickly able to deduce that if God loves me, no one particularly special or virtuous, He certainly must love everyone in the same way, just as we had been told from childhood. I was always a believer in God, but as a young man had found God inconvenient for a while, and I had come back to the church 15 years earlier in another episode which I suspected was a spiritual intervention. But, while I could swear with 100% certainty that I believe it was a spiritual experience, it was one you can think of as \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d, a compulsion to seek out a priest immediately, while this was a \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d one. There was no mistaking this message from God. I practically stopped breathing. It was a 20,000 volt shock, like grabbing a spark plug wire, and just as unmistakable. So what was the outcome? Well, I found another way to volunteer at the VA, one where I was more in contact with the patients. First I read to a group of nursing home patients for about 10 years, and then I began to do bedside visits. In a couple of years I began to find this very difficult as my patients began to die, and I fled by moving to another town and becoming a literacy volunteer. The hot tub message is the defining moment of my life, and I was not told not to talk about it. But speaking has its costs as well, one of which is that it seems to have so little effect on people, while it has revealed the Lord to me. Still, it did not make me into a saint, and I found I still struggle with the same failings that I had before. But it is a great blessing, surpassed only by those experiences in which people have felt the great unconditional love of the Lord for each of us.

I understood the images of Jesus Christ and his heart on fire or raw in a whole new way after that, for that is what I felt. After that first bout of hilarity, I cried on and off for 3 days to realize the depths of the delusion humankind lives in here. And yet I was never unaware of the profound PEACE and LOVE underlying all of creation. How we split the world into parts and names with our minds...when the underlying truth is Love. I understood the difference between Spiritual Reality and the reality we think is real with our minds. I understood transcending the personality. I understood the conditions requisites, if you will to transcending the personality. About 2 years later, this experience gave me the perspective to understand a pattern in my creative works, written decades before, that gave me an insight into the pattern of evolving consciousness, and how that pattern is played out in the advent of the world religions--a model which basically unifies the impulses of all the world religions, each on their own terms (not abstractly) shows that all of humankind is basically on a united, spiritual journey.

1463,DEE,1369,50,,F,"At the age of 50, I had an experience that transformed my life. I had been working with a tool in a secluded area of my home. I left the room for a few minutes, but when I returned, the tool had \xe2\x80\x9cvanished\xe2\x80\x9d and was never seen again. After exhausting every possible explanation for the disappearance, I felt my world falling apart. For the next few days, all I could do was to walk round and round the house in the hope that somehow the tool would mysteriously reappear. The experience was like being thrown into an alien universe, where all the laws of the only universe I had ever known had ceased to exist \xe2\x80\x93 it was like living in a world without gravity. When I eventually regained my composure, I began thinking of ways to solve the mystery. I had heard that the CIA uses psychics, so I made an appointment with one of these people in my area. Although he could not see what had happened to the tool, the psychic indicated that a being on the other side wanted to communicate with me. He described her as wearing a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s uniform and giving her first name as Edith. He could not understand her surname, but he thought it started with a C or a K. When I suggested \xe2\x80\x9cEdith Cavell\xe2\x80\x9d, he told me that was correct. (He had obviously never heard of the remarkable English nurse). Through the psychic, Edith accurately described a pendant I owned. She said I should hold it completely still and then ask her a question. If the answer was \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99, the pendant would move one way; if the answer was \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99, it would move another way. Being of a sceptical disposition, I did not believe that something I owned could ever move of its own accord. But on arriving home, I did what Edith had suggested and to my absolute astonishment, the pendant moved as she had indicated \xe2\x80\x93 either vertically or horizontally. After a new months of fruitful yes/no communication, I asked Edith a question one day, but instead of its usual movements, the pendant swung around in a circle. Eventually I discovered that a circle indicated the need to rephrase the question. Not long after that, Edith changed her mode of communication to one where she caused my hand to move in different directions. Then one day I asked a question, but there was no response. It turned out that Edith was handing me over to someone else. The only way I could ascertain the name of this being was to go through the alphabet. I found it almost impossible to believe that the name of the new guide I was being given was Aristotle. I was in such a state of anxiety that I contacted a renowned psychic without giving him any information about myself. At the consultation he told me he was being given a vision of philosophers in Ancient Greece. This gave me reassurance that I was not losing my mind. Aristotle told me that I should apply to do a PhD in philosophy, and that I should do a lot of background reading. To this day I have never been to a philosophy lecture \xe2\x80\x93 let alone studied in the field. When I eventually rang the Professor I had chosen, he \xe2\x80\x9cforgot\xe2\x80\x9d to ask me about the previous work I had done in philosophy.  After being accepted by the University, I began a difficult journey, but I had a wonderful supervisor who carried me through. At one point Aristotle said I would need to use a concept by the very early philosopher, Anaximander. Of course I had never heard of this thinker, but I used his concept to unite the various ideas I was presenting. Later on, Aristotle handed me over to the modern French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. By this time I had become used to the miraculous, which was just as well, because I found Jacques\xe2\x80\x99 writing difficult to grasp. In the end, thanks to all the help I was given from the other side, the two examiners I had described my dissertation as \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d. (It is titled \xe2\x80\x9cHeidegger and the mystery of being\xe2\x80\x9d and is on the web). Among other things it addresses the question of mysticism, and I am now interested in relating mystical experiences to the idea of the divine. From what I have read in Dr. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s book, and from my own experience, it seems difficult to conceive of God as an all-powerful being who sends people to hell if they don\xe2\x80\x99t repent. The evidence seems to be overwhelming that the whole of the universe is love.

1464,ME ,1478,46,,M,"This life changing event happened to me the latter part of October 2004  For many years I\xe2\x80\x99d been searching for a closer walk with God and financial success. My library of books and tapes are very extensive. I have read many books over twice and listened to tapes and CD\xe2\x80\x99s over and over and over again. I\xe2\x80\x99d started this learning process about 5 years ago and for the last three years I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten very serious about it. So much so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t read the paper, I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch the news on TV and my TV time is limited to almost nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve rented about 5 movies in the last five years. No movie theaters and I\xe2\x80\x99d recently turned off the car radio of any type of media or learning material and just thought positive thoughts while driving. The books that I read are the Bible, books on how our minds work, books on Personal Development and Spirituality. However I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe that the Spirit world existed So one day I have no Idea how I got there but I\xe2\x80\x99m on the website of a well known Success coach and trainer. On her site an interesting book catches my eye. I order the book and it arrives quickly. I start reading the book and it makes allot of sense. About a third way through the book I come upon a passage that says \xe2\x80\x9cOk, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to now tell you about my 5 agreements in business not to be confused with the Four Agreements of Don Miguel Ruiz. If you want to learn about his four agreements you can get his book titled the Four Agreements and read about them\xe2\x80\x9d.  Nothing else was mentioned about that subject and I kept reading. About 3 pages after that statement I felt compelled to go back. I found the author and the title of the book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Four Agreements\xe2\x80\x9d. I was sitting at my desk in front of my computer so I went to Ebay and clicked on a Buy It Now and had the book in my hand three day\xe2\x80\x99s later. I thought it came to me very quickly. The book is written I am told, at a sixth grade level and it has about 140 pages. So I ate it up and read it in about 3 days. After reading it I thought to myself. This book makes so much sense. Just 4 agreements and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to memorize a bunch of affirmations and make sure that I find the right one to say for the situation in my stack of 3X5\xe2\x80\x99 cards. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking this is one of the best books I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and it\xe2\x80\x99s so simple to understand and implement. So I go in for round two with this book. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read it again. About half way through the book is when it happens. My vision: It\xe2\x80\x99s 10:00am and I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting at my home office desk reading the book for the second time. The morning light is shining through my French doors. I\xe2\x80\x99m about half way through it when the room goes dark. I turn my chair to the left toward the light switch to see who\xe2\x80\x99s there. I stand and I drop the book to the floor out of my left hand. My desk is to my right. The book lands on a wood floor, bounces a couple of times and makes an echo like a book bouncing on a wood floor in an empty room. (The floor in my office is carpeted) I look around my room and it\xe2\x80\x99s not my room anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s now as large as a high school gym and empty of everything except for my desk and chair and the floor is wood. My Room looks like an empty school gym. It is then that I see my office door. It\xe2\x80\x99s glowing and the colors on it have changed from white to Lapis Blue and the handle on the door is glowing an Orange/Gold color. The door appears to be breathing in and out. On it\xe2\x80\x99s in breath the door is puffed up and show cracks with the orange/gold color in them. The door and handle are illuminated like they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to explode and catch fire. I see smoke coming in from the door jam around the door frame on its out breath. I walk slowly to the door and grab the handle. I turn it clockwise and crack the door open about an inch to peak outside my room. An intense and bright white light comes through the one inch space. It startles me because of its intense brightness and the speed at which it came through the door so close to my face. The light is just like a laser. It is focused. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like it\xe2\x80\x99s flooding the room with light it\xe2\x80\x99s like a laser beam of bright white/golden light 1 inch wide and as tall as the door. In the light are many small brown particles about the size of pencil erasers. They\xe2\x80\x99re floating and moving along in the light, going by me, not real fast as they come in the door.

I remember saying to myself Ill just go back to sleep and itll be all right in the morning. I fell asleep and saw I was in a tunnel which was lit up. I saw ghostly figures at the end of the tunnel beckoning me forward. Just as I got to the end of the tunnel, it began to recede and I was being drawn back to my bed. This upset me and I fought to get to the light but I couldnt. As I left, one of the ghostly figures told me that if I left I couldnt come back, that this was my only chance to go there. When I woke up, the whole experience felt like a dream, including not being able to move my jaw. I soon forgot about it. Years later when I was in my late thirties, I experienced double vision and went for an MRI. The consultant said I was fine, no problems, but that Id had a mini stroke when I was a teenager. It was then I remembered my experience. I told the consultant what had happened to me at the age of 15, (leaving out the spiritual bit) and he said that it definitely sounded like a mini stroke.

I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished.

No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light.  A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body.

I had finished a line of bracelets and cleared off my beading table, and put away all my beads, to make room for a new line of bracelets I wanted to make. I walked away from the table but when I returned, I saw in the middle of the cleaned-off area a Christian cross made up of small, clear glass pebbles. You know, the kind that are rounded on one side and flat on the other side. I liked these clear glass pebbles and kept a glass of them on my beading table to look at and to play with. The cross was positioned on the table askew--1:00 / 7:00. The lines of the glass pebbled cross were absolutely perfectly straight. The long part of the cross was made up of all one side of the pebbles while the short part was made up of the other side. I stood there and just stared at the glass cross. For the first few seconds, I was in a mild state of shock. I searched my brain to see if I had done that and forgot, but no. I thought if Hank might have done it but didnt think he would have. Then I knew where it came from and got the chills. But I had to eliminate Hank just to be sure, so I called him in. I pointed to the cross and asked if he did this. He stared at the cross and said no. I told him I didnt do it either. I told him that Holy Spirit did it. He didnt say anything about this. We looked at it some more and then went back to work. I tried to Crazy Glue the glass pebbles together to keep it as it was but the round glass pebbles wouldnt hold together even with this glue. The glue residue dirtied up the pretty clear glass pebbles (as you can see in the uploaded image) but I didnt want to clean them off. I wanted to keep them as they were. I put the pebbles in a pretty silk sack and kept it together with my other Signs from God. I went to my spiritual journal and recorded this experience, like I did with all the others. Now I keep these pebbles out in the open in the shape of the cross on a plate with my DAD envelope next to it.

1490,PLR,1006,31,,F,"I was meditating, as I had done hundreds of times before. All of the sudden, I had an experience that felt like a past-life experience. First, you should know that I am a petite female (52, very slender). But in my meditation, all of the sudden I was sitting on a horse and it was sometime around the 10th or 12th century. I was a large man. I could feel my heft. I was wearing a helmet and some kind of armor and vest that had a chain design of some sort. It was heavy.  I had just returned from war. I was going home to my wife and children. I was sitting on my horse, on a hill, looking down at the house towards the right. It was a very long single story house that had a series of very small windows that ran horizontally across the house, and it had a dark roof that looked like it was made of straw or some textured material. It was a dark color and I could see lights from candles inside the house. I knew my wife and children were in there, waiting for my return. I sat and looked at the house and had a feeling of sadness. I was happy to be home but I felt that this life was so hard, war was so hard. It was just a feeling of life being a burden, and feeling sad about all of it. The house was down towards my right, below the hill, and if I looked to my left I could see a harbor which is where I had some from. There were boats. I remember that it was very cold. And I remember that I could feel my heft. Like I could actually feel what it felt like to be that large. I knew what the name of the harbor was. Then all of the sudden I was standing on something that is hard to describe it was like a wooden platform or large wood cart with wheels and it was being pulled by horses. I was standing on it and holding the reigns while the horses pulled this thing I was standing on. We were entering a castle. I worked at the castle. I was some kind of fighter.

1491,ADC,1153,44,,F,"My best friend passed into Spirit on May 15, 2004 at the age of 45, after a 10 year battle with HER-2 Breast Cancer. We had spent 40 years weaving the fabric of our lives together in a dance that was just magical. Ours is a long story of love and friendship. It is hard to relay in a few words the significance of this miracle,but I will try.  Two years ago Karen started having massive headaches and was feeling weird. We were headed off to a healing weekend in New York State and having a grand time. It was just the two of us tooling around in the car and laughing and enjoying each others company. At one point, she became very serious and told me she thought her chemotherapy may be causing these symptoms. She was struggling as to whether or not to go off the chemo and just let God do His work. I told her this was a huge decision and one not to be taken lightly. I am a big believer in asking God to give us a sign when we need an answer to an important or not so important question. Because this was a VERY important question, I told her she needed to ask for a sign that would be unquestionable! Something so unusual that it could only be from God. I then said, How about if we see a green donkey? Then you can go off chemotherapy. She giggled and said, That sounds great. The rest of the weekend we searched for a green donkey. We found yellow pigs, purple cows, red dogs and even a green horse.How we tried to rationalize that a horse is almost a donkey. But we knew it had to be a Green Donkey. We even spent the next afternoon in Woodstock, NY going through every store but never found a green donkey. A week later the headaches continued and she went for an MRI. Her father also passed away from Alzheimers this same week. On the morning of his funeral, she received a phone call from her oncologist telling her the cancer had spread to her brain. She went through the whole day, a huge funeral, and never told a soul except her husband what she had found out that morning. She had courage beyond human strength. She made it through brain surgery and massive radiation and lived two more years. She passed on May 15, 2004 surrounded by her whole family. What follows is what I said at her memorial service (which 700 people attended). Notice the part about the green donkey toward the end. I have had the pleasure of knowing Karen for over 40 years and calling her one of my best and dearest friends. But I know I am just one of countless best friends that Karen had...there was something about her that just made you want to be close to her and know her better. To Karens family...she was a mom, a wife, a sister, a daughter, and a cousin, but for the vast majority of us here today, she was our friend. A friend of the truest sense and one that was there for each of us no matter what was going on in her life. Remarkable, selfless, trustworthy, sincere, kind, compassionate, spiritual, and beautiful are words that can only begin to describe Karen. Besides being a friend,Karen was a teacher. She taught me more about strength and courage than I ever wanted to know. When my son deployed to Afghanistan last Oct, she came to me one day like an angel sent from God. She held me, cried with me and instilled in me The Power of Now. This gave me strength that I did not know I had. If I can take one tenth of her strength and live the rest of my life, then I will be happy. I will miss her human presence more than I can even imagine at this time... her spirit while she was on this Earth was immeasurable. What I look forward to from this day on is how she will guide, love, and watch over each of us in her new found strength in SPIRIT. And so I say to you my dear Karen, Godspeed to you on this new journey you have undertaken. I know Daddy was holding your green donkey and that now you know all the Divine Order that is so hard for us to understand here on Earth. I giggle at the thought of our next life together and I ask you Sister Karen to hold down the abbey until I get there. When I returned home from her service that evening, there was a message on my answering machine from my son, who was in Afghanistan, serving in the US Army. He had never, ever called on a weeknight since he had deployed, until that night. This in and of itself spoke volumes to me. I was sad I had missed his call, but I knew he was OK and surely sending me some love from afar, even though he did not know of Karens death yet. Karen had given me extreme comfort and support while she was alive in regards to his deployment and no matter what was going on in her life, she always asked how my son was doing. That same night, the phone rang again around 2:30 AM and it was my son. What a joy to hear his voice! We spoke for about 20 minutes and during the conversation he mentioned that his best buddy and teammate had put new pictures up on a website ",,Citizen,1 2000,spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,very strong,moder,"0 24,999",colle,At the,,single,single,No,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

1493,NDE,1138,34,,F,"As I pondered my situation, I slowly became aware of overwhelming feelings of peace, love, acceptance, and certain knowledge of perfection and purpose. I felt great awe. It quickly became clear to me that the light was the ultimate intellect, love, and creative force. The psychological environment in which I now existed literally permeated around and through me. I knew that Light knew my every nuance, every thought, and every deed. Amazingly, it still loved me, even viewed me with a certain sense of delighted humor. In an odd way the Light was part of me. Yet it was also everything else. As I easily, and happily, settled into this new environment I realized that time and space were very different than what I was used to. I could follow multiple trains of thought and experience in what seemed to be a simultaneous manner. It was akin to how we use time in dreams in that numerous situations were playing out in \xe2\x80\x98no time\xe2\x80\x99. I was luxuriating in the perfection of the situation, while simultaneously making mental notes of my surroundings. At the same time, Light was addressing me thru telepathy and instilling within me what I later called scrolls of knowledge. These scrolls unraveled and revealed information about the true nature of reality. I think that the figurative scrolls were thought forms that existed within Light and Light was mentally pushing them onto my consciousness. I had no idea what they meant, as the ideas and knowledge contained within was light years more complex than I could grasp. I sensed the periphery and intent of the scrolls and knew that it would take eternity to sort it all out. Still, the bit I could sort out made it clear that in the physical dimension we are capable of experience far beyond what we ever imagined. Prior to the NDE I had experienced three enormously frightening out-of-bodies. Frightening because I \xe2\x80\x98caught myself\xe2\x80\x99 in the upper corner of the ceiling, watching myself sleep on each occasion. I did not know what was happening. I had never heard of an out-of-body experience. Now I knew, clearly, that the out-of-bodies were normal, and just the tip of the iceberg of what humans could and should experience. I received, thru telepathically transmitted images and thoughts, a glimpse of the fully developed multi-dimensional being. As I floated within Light, numerous paths of information were being delivered to me. I felt peaceful, and perfect. Suddenly I heard a deep male voice say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go back?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBack?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cback to where?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to go back, concentrate on that noise\xe2\x80\x9d, it said. My thought was NO; I do not want to go anywhere! The thought of leaving this new, yet strangely familiar, environment seemed a travesty. Still for some reason I turned my attention slightly to the left. Far away, as if thru a long train tunnel, I heard a faint noise. As I listened more intently, it got louder. I realized it was my beloved husband Ed. He was screaming my name. The next thing I knew, I was coming to consciousness in my bed. After returning to physicality I felt very lethargic and drifted off to sleep. The NDE remained clear in my mind. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it was, having never heard of an NDE, but I knew it was real. The next day Ed phoned me at work and said he had scheduled an appointment with my doctor, and was coming over to take me to it. At the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office he said I had been having some sort of seizure that did not involve convulsions. It was more like a dead person. He said my body had seized up like it was frozen and my eyes had rolled back in my head. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me until now, as he did not want to scare me. I thought I had just lost consciousness.

1503,OBE,1133,39,,M,"The night before I had this experience was a very emotional point in my life, the world seemed so terribly unjust and cruel that I was at a breaking point, that evening when arriving home walking from my car to the front door I paused to look up into the star filled sky with tears rolling down my cheeks quietly cried Why, why, why? I could not understand how the complete innocents of this world could be treated so terribly, how children could suffer so unjustly under the hand of others. I cried to sky as the universe because I could not believe in a God and had little faith in anything spiritual, if any.  Since rejecting the belief in God at the age of about 22, I did not believe such a thing could exist, because any such God which would allow these kinds of things to happen wasnt any kind of God to me. I couldnt pray to the concept of God but the universe was real, the immense out there, the all that is was something I could pour out my heart to without needing a belief in God. That night I gave the heavens my full heart seeking an answer to that question, with all my heart tearfully pleading for the answer. The next afternoon I received an answer to that question; since we are all a part of one another we do it to ourselves.  Although the answer didnt completely make up for all of the pain, much of the edge of that pain was taken off by finally being able to understand why such terrible things could happen to others in our world, to simply understand we have the freedom of choice to do such things because in the wider perspective the reality is we are all one and in that hurting no one else other than ourselves. Because of this and this alone we are allowed the freedom to do good or evil, if we werent really one I do not believe the spiritual heart of life would allow such to occur, call that center God, the conscious collective, the collective soul or what ever name you might choose. I finally came to understand, in the end we all pay the price for any wrong as well as reap the reward for any good and this took away much of the anger I had against reality for allowing terrible things to happen to good people.  The following is how the answer came to me through a dream-vision which was the most lucid moment of my life before or since but I must also add the following; the experience and my conclusions from it are my own made from who I am as a individual and how I saw the experience. Was it really God on high I met? I thought it was but beyond my own belief I cannot say it was, perhaps I met a collective soul which was so wonderful to me I thought it was God when in fact God might be levels above, so to speak,.   The Vision: Meeting a Sun-Intelligence-God. Sun of Souls~Souls of Sun; One Spirit~One Life.  Note: This experience was no doubt individually viewed through my own shade of colored glasses, limited to my own ability to understand things at the time, how I needed to be shown who we really are. This may have been brought on by severe apnea, a problem I had where I could stop breathing for long periods of time. I believe I may have stopped breathing for far too long that afternoon and had come close to death producing this NDE-like experience. I dont really know if this was a OOBE or due to apnea, but either way, what ever caused the experience it deeply impacted my outlook on life, what and who we really are.  One warm afternoon in 1996 I took a short nap and unexpectedly awoke within my slumber to find myself in a vast void in the presence of a huge sun or sphere of light, quickly coming to the understanding that this sun was pure conscious awareness. I was completely surprised to find myself so fully conscious in this empty but light-filled void which I knew to be more real than waking reality, in this place feeling super-conscious beyond anything I had experienced before. Although the light was without any kind of visual hint of facial features, I strongly sensed it smiling nothing but love for me and through those feelings knowing an unseen face.  While in the presence of this light I immediately and fully felt it peering deeply into my own awareness, lovingly knowing everything about me all at once. Feeling such love coming from this light I suddenly came to an awareness that this sun was God! I was so overwhelmed and surprised that God was real that I mentally gasped and then yelled out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Real!\xe2\x80\x9d. Just prior to this experience I had a deep mistrust of religion and rejected the concept of any kind of God or creator, much less the idea there was any continuation for human beings beyond our physical lives. Years before this experience, I had decided for many seemingly valid reasons that religion and God were only a product of the human mind, yet there I was standing in the presence of what I knew without a doubt wa",,USA    Q.,"25,000",agnostic,atheist,Christian,Christian,,,dail,never,very strong,littl,"50,000 99",Did not,Satelli,,marri,single,Yes,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

1512,DEE,1205,45,,F,"Well it has been a few years, but here is what happened. I was at Mass. We attend weekly. This week, for some reason, my eyes kept being drawn towards the rafters above the altar. I kept feeling a presence, actually two, playfully going from rafter to rafter. Ive felt presences before, never at church. Whenever I do, I usually just ignore, or if it is strong enough, tell it to call on the name of Christ. So the feeling kept getting stronger and stronger, I finally stated silently for the things to play quieter so I could concentrate on the Mass. They didnt leave though. And we lined up for the Holy Eucharist, and I received the Body of Christ from Rita, a long time parishoner and dedicated Eucharistic minister. As soon as she gave the Host to me, I didnt even get to walk to my seat when I heard a loud CRASH! The silver bowl witht the Host was dropped because Rita collapsed and died on the spot. As soon as that happened, I slowly felt the presences leave. Come to find out about a week later at Ritas funeral, that she used to be a nun, she was in love with the Eucharist, and her life-long wish was to die IN THE CHURCH, GIVING OUT THE EUCHARIST. Those angels in the rafters (or whatever celestial beings they were) were there for Rita. I only observed, or felt their presence. This isnt the first time Ive felt unearthly presences, but most definitely the strongest.

1513,ME ,1440,21,,F,"Dear Dr. Alexander, Thank you so much for your book, Proof of Heaven. I have not had a NDE, but I experience a variety of connections with/in my own body. I thought I would share them with you so that you might be able to incorporate these ideas and implications into the knowledge you now possess. Mini-bio: I am 32 years old, lesbian, a former college athlete, white, middle-class/U.S., non-religious. When I was in my teens, I was inexplicably drawn to spiritual books for the greater part of 2-3 years, and then that continued into college (previously, I detested reading anything). There was no explanation for this; I detested organized religion as well. I read books by Brian Weiss Many Lives, Many Masters; Charles Tart (actually flew to California to see him speak); Gary Schwartz, among many others. I found myself reading anything and everything I could find on reincarnation, psychics, NDEs, mystical ideas and the like. As I read more, it seemed like the reading experience was such that the more I read, the deeper I went into things I already knew...and that is what kept me reading. In part, I also think that I connected this knowledge with a more sociological knowledge of the body/spirit, particularly by way of sexuality since I was also, simultaneously, coming into the awakening of my sexuality and the relationship between aesthetic experience and physical sensation. For me, there was this immediate connection between sexuality and spirituality. At any rate, I went on in college to major in psychology, sociology, and religion/philosophy. I was one of the very few students in school that defended the reality of psi phenomenon, having never literally not really experienced it myself up to that point. I read the stories and just knew they were real. As I read more, and defended the idea more and more, I began to experience more in the way of expanded consciousness. All of this started shortly after this 2-3 year stint of reading. My clairvoyance is somehow limited by time; I know things are going to happen and Im informed of them, but only about 10 minutes prior. I receive information/images in the waking state in the form of symbolic interactions i.e. ideas are communicated by the meaning my psyche will construct if I cogitate about what very material relations actually mean or feel like specifically to me i.e. the particular is what carries the universal intent of the message/the lesson. In your terminology, I think that is my bodys way of adapting to the inflow of messages that it knows are from the outside. Most often, it goes like this: I will be receiving information that I can feel is information coming through and I will pay very close attention to the content because I know it is not just my own random thoughts (i.e. I would probably be a good receiver in telepathic studies). I will then obsess about what I can make of the structural relations of that content in the very context of my theoretical/sociological categories/knowledge...because it seems to me that it is in figuring out that puzzle that explains why it is that Im receiving that message. Sometimes I can figure out who it needs to reach. I guess this ties in with the quotation on your website that all thoughts and actions are interconnected...and that is true at every level. Story 2: Although it may have nothing or everything do with me, the night I was on my bed studying, crying, and mourning my deceased cousin who died the night prior she came to visit me by staging a physical impossibility... because she knew that would register to me (Im also a very scientific mind I see the possible by way of the impossible. My family makes fun of me for always asking for percentages and probabilities in all aspects of life). :) Anyway, the night prior to this, I remember the light bulb above my bed blowing out I could hear the filament hit the glass of the bulb. Nonetheless, I had left the light switch up/circuit open. As I was sitting there crying the second night, thinking about Beth, and feeling guilty that we had not connected more the year before when she requested that, the light illuminated in a fashion akin to those lights that very gradually get brighter/lighter by touch. It lasted for about 10 seconds. It illuminated in a way that is not possible given the type of light it is; it wasnt on a dimmer switch. And the visual was as if a blast of energy had simply traveled through the space. I know to a degree of 100% that this light bulb had totally and completely blown out the night prior. I was sitting in the exact same place. I immediately knew it was her, and was immediately brought to tears, again. I verbally thanked her. The next day I took the light bulb to a philosophy professor of mine who was very familiar with modern physics. He was a materialist.

1529,NDE,1138,34,,F,"As I pondered my situation, I slowly became aware of overwhelming feelings of peace, love, acceptance, and certain knowledge of perfection and purpose. I felt great awe. It quickly became clear to me that the light was the ultimate intellect, love, and creative force. The psychological environment in which I now existed literally permeated around and through me. I knew that Light knew my every nuance, every thought, and every deed. Amazingly, it still loved me, even viewed me with a certain sense of delighted humor. In an odd way the Light was part of me. Yet it was also everything else. As I easily, and happily, settled into this new environment I realized that time and space were very different than what I was used to. I could follow multiple trains of thought and experience in what seemed to be a simultaneous manner. It was akin to how we use time in dreams in that numerous situations were playing out in \xe2\x80\x98no time\xe2\x80\x99. I was luxuriating in the perfection of the situation, while simultaneously making mental notes of my surroundings. At the same time, Light was addressing me thru telepathy and instilling within me what I later called scrolls of knowledge. These scrolls unraveled and revealed information about the true nature of reality. I think that the figurative scrolls were thought forms that existed within Light and Light was mentally pushing them onto my consciousness. I had no idea what they meant, as the ideas and knowledge contained within was light years more complex than I could grasp. I sensed the periphery and intent of the scrolls and knew that it would take eternity to sort it all out. Still, the bit I could sort out made it clear that in the physical dimension we are capable of experience far beyond what we ever imagined. Prior to the NDE I had experienced three enormously frightening out-of-bodies. Frightening because I \xe2\x80\x98caught myself\xe2\x80\x99 in the upper corner of the ceiling, watching myself sleep on each occasion. I did not know what was happening. I had never heard of an out-of-body experience. Now I knew, clearly, that the out-of-bodies were normal, and just the tip of the iceberg of what humans could and should experience. I received, thru telepathically transmitted images and thoughts, a glimpse of the fully developed multi-dimensional being. As I floated within Light, numerous paths of information were being delivered to me. I felt peaceful, and perfect. Suddenly I heard a deep male voice say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go back?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBack?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cback to where?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to go back, concentrate on that noise\xe2\x80\x9d, it said. My thought was NO; I do not want to go anywhere! The thought of leaving this new, yet strangely familiar, environment seemed a travesty. Still for some reason I turned my attention slightly to the left. Far away, as if thru a long train tunnel, I heard a faint noise. As I listened more intently, it got louder. I realized it was my beloved husband Ed. He was screaming my name. The next thing I knew, I was coming to consciousness in my bed. After returning to physicality I felt very lethargic and drifted off to sleep. The NDE remained clear in my mind. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it was, having never heard of an NDE, but I knew it was real. The next day Ed phoned me at work and said he had scheduled an appointment with my doctor, and was coming over to take me to it. At the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office he said I had been having some sort of seizure that did not involve convulsions. It was more like a dead person. He said my body had seized up like it was frozen and my eyes had rolled back in my head. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me until now, as he did not want to scare me. I thought I had just lost consciousness.

1530,ME ,1269,59,,F,"(Repeat of #43) I was driving my car alone and running errands during the daytime. It was an ordinary, sunny July day during the week. I was driving past the Briarcliff Congregational Church in Briarcliff Manor, New York, a small, Westchester County suburban community, a one-hour drive north of Manhattan. I glanced over at the churchs directory sign to read it. It said You say theres distance between you and God. Who moved? I immediately stopped my car and held up traffic, stared at those words and thought for a few seconds about that question. I remember answering that question to myself: I moved. It was I who moved because God doesnt move. Hes all around us. I suddenly realized what I was saying and I said to myself: Why am I answering this question? I dont believe in God. Then I started to cry and I was shaking in my car. It was a soft cry and a mild shaking. But I was aware that I was being moved by something. I heard the car horns blaring behind me but ignored them. I knew I had to make an instant decision to stay with this feeling or cut it off, ignore it and continue on with my chores. Although I was a little frightened at the unknown feelings and event that were overtaking me, I decided to stay with my feelings. I pulled across the street into the empty parking lot of the little Briarcliff Public Library and parked in a quiet corner of the lot. I sat crying and shaking and let whatever it was overtake me. I was still a little frightened but I decided to trust the event. I suddenly looked down and saw that my chest was ethereally slowly opening up and a current of wavy air was entering my chest. This did not at all frighten me. I did not hear anything, touch anything or smell anything. (With me, all my visions, signs and visits by Holy Spirit were always visual. I guess since God made me a visual artist, It comes to me in a visual form.) God then played with me a game of spiritual connect the dots. It released from my memory spiritual experiences from my past that I had heretofore forgotten but remembered when they became fresh again in my memory. (Ill be registering each one in separate forms on your site.) I was sitting in my car for about one half hour and in that half hour I went from believing nothing to believing everything. I knew there really was a God. I knew that Jesus was the Son of God. I knew there really was a Holy Spirit. I knew the Bible was true. And I felt that God wanted me to be Christian, so I converted myself from Judaism to Christianity on the spot. No one came over to me while I sat in my car. I was infused with a tremendous new and exciting spiritual energy and couldnt wait to go home and tell Hank, my husband, all about it.

1532,OBE,1238,34,,F,"Thank you very much for creating a space for these stories. I am very excited to tell mine. I am an artist and at the time I was transitioning from sculpture to painting. This extraordinary experience happened about thirty years ago.   One afternoon, before leaving for work, I decided to do a short meditation. I sat down on a carpet in my living room and assumed a meditation position. Moments after I closed my eyes, a clear blue window-like space appeared on the left side of the horizon. My conscious self became molecular, like a blip, or a tigle and I moved at the speed of light through the space. I first saw the edge of a sea. Beautiful sand edged the pristine waters which were gently rolling on to the shore. The area was completely clear of any vegetation or trees. I then found myself in the air, looking down at circular homes which were in a row. They were reminiscent of yurts or hogans. Then quick as a flash, I was inside, looking at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s back. She was tall, dressed in a black robe with crystals around her head. Telepathically I knew that she was a Priestess, a Healer. The Priestess was standing before an altar of some kind. Next, a small room emanating magenta light came into view. The room was translucent; the walls, ceiling, and floor emanated this gorgeous magenta light. Another room stood beside it, emanating a beautiful clear green light. Instantly I understood that these were healing rooms and that this civilization used color for healing and balancing the body.   I found myself outside, watching women and children playing on a hill. It was a bright sunny day and the children were laughing and chatting. On the hilltop there was a white stone post and lintel with three square colors atop the lintel. The colors were tints of the primary colors of red, yellow and blue. Every now and then a boy would run under the post and lintel to stand for a few moments. Then he would zip out to play again. I understood that this structure helped boys balance their chakra energy; it helped their energy flow without hindrance. Only the boys needed it; it was not necessary for the girls to do this.   Lastly, I found myself looking at the back of an old woman who was sitting on a bench. She was contemplating an exterior mosaic or mural that covered a long low wall. I approached this very colorful abstract wall. Soft sounds emanated from it as the colors moved and fused into each other. I knew that my gross ears could not hear the extraordinary beauty of the music that was created by the fusing colors. The wall was alive, changing into different configurations of beauty, much like a kaleidoscope. The old woman had created this beautiful wall and it was she who was responsible for bringing the concept of color healing into this civilization.      I re-entered my body with a great jerk and my eyes opened. I got up from my spot on the floor and went to work in a daze. There is no way for me to put into words how life changing this event has been. Seeing this beautiful world allowed me to understand the power and healing properties of color and sound. I continue to make art that will bring beauty and healing forces into our world.

But, it wasnt, really. I am very thankful to be able to tell this story. As I recount it, part of me takes the results for granted-(foolish human). It was Divine intervention, I have no doubt.

1539,OBE,1477,53,,M,"Lets take a trip......this is not any trip, this is my trip and it happened the night or second night home from the hospital. I began traveling through a darkness. It is BLACK! no stars, no planets, no lights, NOTHING! Void. A black hole I dont know what else to call it. Except in a very, very, very far distance is a very small gold and I mean GOLD light flickering like a candle or generator running off cycle or something. I began to get closer and closer. The GOLD light grew larger and larger and closer and closer. As I got close enough I could tell what looked like a snow globe or very lucent clear crystal ball and this GOLD light was inside this globe. As I got closer I could tell inside this globe were what looked like stars. Sort of looking into the sky from earth. But inside this globe these stars were very bright or a crystal or bright white. It is nothing I have ever seen before or can compare to it. There were no bright and dim stars, they were all the same. In this middle was this Golf glowing light. I did not go inside this and was kept at a distance hanging out in this blackness. On the way all I could feel is a state of AWE! no words, just a beyond any middle boggling experience anyone could have imagined. On this travel it was like your mind is wondering out there and focused on this GOLD light thinking what is going on?. Getting closer to this globe I noticed I began getting messages or bits of information or something that seem to be sending these messages to me. These messages begin telling me some things I need to work on. Which I did not understand at all. I am beginning to get a better understanding each day since. There were many messages or I guess even judgements that I received in which stated I did or just point out or something (still processing) but three Primary things I need to do before I am to enter or go to or inside this globe. There is way too much for me to put onto here. All I know is I was told to do this. One of my things is that I am to teach, speak, talk about Forgiveness. As this is one of my things I have to do and that is because this is the best way to learn it. This is all for now as I need to go rest. (try to sleep). I really cannot put into words what happened but it was very real to me. I was not on any drugs these nights and am not now either. I cant stand the pain drugs, although I know many wanting them.

1547,NDE,1276,45,,M,"My first memories was a sense of unnatural sounds like the building itself was breathing or living somehow. I saw through the walls to a room that I knew was on another dimension or in a spiritual plane. In this room, men sat and leaned against the walls while they waited. I knew somehow that they were waiting to escort the dead to another place. I knew that I was close to death in this moment and that was the reason I could see them. I was not afraid. I just knew it.  My next memory was of a village setting that looked medieval or European. The streets were cobble stone and the buildings were stone as well. People walked in groups down the road. I think a better description would be that they wondered aimlessly. They looked straight ahead, slightly downward and seemed to be without hope. I had an overwhelming feeling of gloom in this place and I felt as though they were being punished or detained in some way.  The thing that was MOST striking about these visions was there absolute vividness. It was as though I was seeing them with the most high definition TV ever seen. I could not explain how powerful this sense of visual clarity was. It was as though it were more real than real life. Even though these people seemed as though they were not supposed to look at me, occasionally one would lock eyes with me for just a moment. They had such despair in their eyes that it saddened me to make eye contact.  Later I was in this same place in a large arena, though that is not really the right word. It was a place in a large building that had a circular path that came in one door and passed in front of what seemed to be stadium type seating.  I had a feeling that people were paraded through this place in the lines I had seen them walking in on the streets to possibly be judged or reviewed in some way. Again, the architecture was like nothing I have seen here in the states. It seemed very old and mostly made from stone.  My next and final memory was my defining moment where I was like a speck dust floating in a space that felt like a large room. I was exactly like those particles of dust that you see floating randomly in the open space of a room as the sunlight passes through a window. I was free, floating on an invisible river of air through this space, around a tree or plant, feeling sheer joy and amazement. I had no identity in these moments. I had no memory of anything personal or earthly. I only knew that I was truly at peace. I was one with the universe, completely accepted, and loved. I felt such joy in those brief moments that it makes my heart race even now as I recall it. As I passed through this space, I saw a very obvious ray of what I thought was sunshine coming downward from the right from no obvious window or light source. I didnt question anything, but I remember a sense of really hoping that I would drift through this light. As I did enter the light, I felt happiness like I have never known. I felt as though anything I had known before this moment was infantile and insignificant. I knew this was the presence of God, though I did not see a face. I dont even know that I had the ability to look at the source of the light. I just basked in its glory.  I saw flashes or arcs of light zipping above me. They looked like just that really, but I felt like they were something bigger than me, something more than I could even try to understand. Later, I remembered seeing a phenomenon called flying rods that I have seen myself in videos that I have where these things that are not visible to the naked eye show up on high speed video and they appear to swim through the sky with multiple wings on a straight translucent body.  I wonder if these could be what I saw in this place. As far as I know this phenomenon is not explained scientifically yet, but you can find hundreds or thousands of video accounts on youtube by searching for flying rods. I may be nothing, but then again...  I had a number of very substantial things that became known to me in this place. For one, the reason that everyone describes these visions as being so vivid is that we are not looking at them with our failing human eyes. We are seeing them in a supernatural state of being where our tired old eyeballs could not even begin to compare. Also, I became acutely aware that I am a being inside of a being. I felt that I am a spirit aside from the conscious brain thought, which I always thought was ME. Suddenly, I had all of these memories of things like driving on long trips when I am complete zoned out in deep thought, yet somehow my body is driving the car, slowing and speeding up in traffic, using turn signals, and yet I arrive 30 miles later not remembering the drive.

Intuitively I knew it was the boys father who had unknowingly run over, and killed the child.  Immediately the infant boys essense popped out of his body.

1549,NDA,1386,17,,F,"One night, I had a dream. I remember being outside of my grandfather house. Outside of the house was my grandfather. He approached me, and we were happy to see each other. I knew it had been a while since I saw him. And, I also knew that she was currently sick and afraid of him leaving me [to the afterlife]. My grandfather took my hand, and we walked into his house. The view inside the house, during the dream, was identical to his real house. What I found unusual was that all the lights were out except the one straight ahead- his room.  As we proceeded to walk towards his room, he was telling me that things were going to be fine. That, at first, things were going to feel like they are spinning out of control. As if I was standing with my arms out, spinning in circles, losing my balance- THAT type of loss of control. Although I found comfort in his words, I didnt know what he actually meant, until after his death.  When we approached the bedroom door, I could not believe my eyes. In front of me, was a hospital bed and my grandfather was in it! My grandfather was in his bed, facing my direction; he was asleep. Behind him, sitting, was his 2nd wife, his daughter, Lucy, and his son, Danny. To my left [and my grandfathers], sitting on a chair, was my mother. All of them were looking straight at my grandfather. I could not believe that I was in the presence of two grandfathers- and the same one!!  Seeing my grandfather in the hospital bed created a magnetic pull. I could not remove my eyes from him. I had never seen him in such a state. He was always alert, active, and immediately greeting me. This was the first time that I ever saw him so disconnected from everyone else, especially in their presence.  Seeing that there was an empty chair right next to his bed, I immediately sat on it. I felt I was trying to be close to him as I possibly could. This was the man I had loved all my life. He was my father, my comfort, and my strength. I admired this man profusely. And, knowing that I had denied seeing him for so many months, he needed to know I was finally there.  I apologized to him for not being there for when he needed me the most. I told him I was scared of losing him and I was scared that he would pass away once he already saw me. (He had seen every family member, but me. Due to how our relationship was, my withdrawal had shocked everyone. I thought you loved your grandfather, why arent you seeing him? You know that he is dying. Go see him.) Once I finished venting to my grandfather, asking him for forgiveness, his eyes opened. He looked at me. I returned the look. And he closed them again. Right then I knew that I was right. He WAS waiting for me. He wasnt leaving yet because we hadnt said goodbye. And I was the last person that he needed to see. But, I knew that I wasnt ready to let him go. Feeling overwhelmed, I reached out to him. I went for his hand and I grabbed it. It was my first touch with him in months. And once I held his hand, I heard his last breath. I was then informed he died. Everyone around was crying, including myself. With the pain of a broken heart, and having everything feel so real, I immediately woke up from my dream. I woke up sweating and bursting into tears. I could not stop crying. I had felt as if my grandfather had truly passed away.  My mother, who was sleeping next to me at the time (she didnt want to be alone during this moment in her life- being a daddys girl) woke up with fright. She didnt know what happened to me. I relived the dream by telling her every single detail. She reached out to a relative who informed her that my grandfather was still alive. - Exactly one week later, still fearful of my dream, and still avoiding seeing my dying grandfather, my mom informed me that she had just seen my grandfather. She informed me that now it was just a matter of hours or minutes. Without thinking, I immediately got ready. It was probably 10:00-11:00 at night. On my way over there, those fears werent present. But once I walked up to my grandfathers door- all my fears came flooding back. I did not know what to expect. Was my dream just a dream? Or, would it become a reality?? As my mother and I walked in through the door. My heart slumped to the bottom of my stomach. Just like my dream- the house was dark except for the back room- my grandfathers room. I began to experience anxiety. I was praying my steps towards the room would be nothing like my dream. I had so much hope in those few seconds which felt like an hour. When I walked into the bedroom, there he was: my grandfather laying on a bed, facing my direction. Behind him, my 2nd wife, my aunt Lucy, and my uncle Danny. My mother took a seat to my left.

1555,DEE,1542,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

This week, for some reason, my eyes kept being drawn towards the rafters above the altar. I kept feeling a presence, actually two, playfully going from rafter to rafter. Ive felt presences before, never at church. Whenever I do, I usually just ignore, or if it is strong enough, tell it to call on the name of Christ. So the feeling kept getting stronger and stronger, I finally stated silently for the things to play quieter so I could concentrate on the Mass. They didnt leave though. And we lined up for the Holy Eucharist, and I received the Body of Christ from Rita, a long time parishoner and dedicated Eucharistic minister. As soon as she gave the Host to me, I didnt even get to walk to my seat when I heard a loud CRASH! The silver bowl witht the Host was dropped because Rita collapsed and died on the spot. As soon as that happened, I slowly felt the presences leave. Come to find out about a week later at Ritas funeral, that she used to be a nun, she was in love with the Eucharist, and her life-long wish was to die IN THE CHURCH, GIVING OUT THE EUCHARIST. Those angels in the rafters (or whatever celestial beings they were) were there for Rita. I only observed, or felt their presence. This isnt the first time Ive felt unearthly presences, but most definitely the strongest.

He actually was a kindly old gentleman who even remembered the neighborhood children in his will but for whatever reason I was very frightened of him.

1590,NDE,1065,42,,M,"From an account I wrote for my family and friends in 2001. The big event happened one night while we were visiting the Oregon Coast. We had not planned to spend the night- but did at the last minute. The only available motel was an older place with horrible soft, old mattresses. From what I can figure out- halfway through the night, while kind of curled up against the wall, I slipped off the mattress, and got wedged between the wall and the mattress. I then had an apnea attack- and the inability to move, or breath, sent me into some state of cardiac failure. This is all conjecture, and only supported by the mild abnormality in my EKG over the past years since. Whether I coded or not, is really not at the heart of the issue or my experience. There are tons of debates regarding what really happens when you die by both medical and theological theorists worldwide. I can only relate what I experienced.  I admit that even as I write, it sounds like science fiction- but I can assure you that it happened- and I believe it to be real in every sense.  Without trying to be overly dramatic, the next events were what I have found to be in subsequent studies, a classic Near Death Experience. I did not see myself in bed (many report floating over their bodies), as the room was too dark- but I was blasted through an amazing tunnel (plasma? lights? not sure) of brightness that brought me ever closer to an unbelievable bright light. In what seemed like minutes (regular time does not seem to apply)- I arrived in a place that was so overwhelmingly bright and swimming with fluid colors of the entire spectrum, that I did not at first realize that I was without my physical body. While I could see- or at least had a sense of the vision that I was seeing- I could not see my hands. It was about this time that my experience was significantly different than others I have read about.  I realized what was happening, and I was not happy about it. Almost immediately, I started screaming, in a voice that I could hear in my head- but could not physically perceive- No f***ing way! (except there are no asterisks in heaven) NO! I am not finished yet! I still have young children- I have not seen my life through yet! NO Damn It! I continued with a stream of verbal abuse of anyone that was listening\xe2\x80\xa6in very profane language, until I heard another voice say, OK\xe2\x80\xa6relax\xe2\x80\xa6its not your time.  I knew at that moment, two very clear truths to be real. First, I was not going to die yet (or stay dead if I was). Second, there was a God and an afterlife beyond our life on earth. Then things got strange, interesting and terrifying.  Unlike other NDE experiences I have read about, I did not see anyone, or feel the presence of Jesus, or Buddha, or Allah. Nor did I see a physical presence of any of my relatives that had passed before me- although I had a feeling that they were there with me.  What I did see was a much brighter place, perhaps 30-50- feet away (I had no real clear understanding of depth or ratio) that seemed almost to pull at my heart (if I had a heart) to come closer. I was awash with a complete feeling of peace, calm and contentment whenever I looked in the direction of this portal. And yet I knew, that moving into the portal would certainly mean that I would not be able to return to my life on earth.  Without speaking, and yet speaking and understanding what was spoken to me, a conversation ensued that changed my life.  You are troubled\xe2\x80\xa6 the voice said. Your need to know the truth about your life, is holding you back from living your life to the fullest.I agreed without speaking.  You must understand the gift to be able to enjoy and treasure the gift that you have been given, the voice said. At this time, while the voice was neither clearly male or female (I realize that does not make a lot of sense), I knew that the communication was coming from all that is\xe2\x80\xa6all that was\xe2\x80\xa6all that ever shall be. The voice was that of what I understood to be God. And yet- even then- while thinking this, it was evident that the entity knew what I was thinking- and chastised me for doubting, or trying to figure out its very existence.  In order to understand that which you feel you must understand to be happy, you must first know what you need to change in your life on earth, the voice said.  In an instant, I was seeing my life in review- first all of the wonderful feelings that had brought joy into my life. I saw all of the incredible events of my life when love, the most powerful positive force in existence, was most present in my life. Childhood memories, my first real loves, the births of my children, the first time I knew I loved my wife more than I loved myself- anything and everything associated with love in my life- flying past my eyes and filling my ",,US Citize,"251,00",spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,moder,littl,"100,000+",some,Owner o,,marri,marri,Yes,moderately str,Pleasant & distressing,adult

1593,OBE,1238,34,,F,"Thank you very much for creating a space for these stories. I am very excited to tell mine. I am an artist and at the time I was transitioning from sculpture to painting. This extraordinary experience happened about thirty years ago.   One afternoon, before leaving for work, I decided to do a short meditation. I sat down on a carpet in my living room and assumed a meditation position. Moments after I closed my eyes, a clear blue window-like space appeared on the left side of the horizon. My conscious self became molecular, like a blip, or a tigle and I moved at the speed of light through the space. I first saw the edge of a sea. Beautiful sand edged the pristine waters which were gently rolling on to the shore. The area was completely clear of any vegetation or trees. I then found myself in the air, looking down at circular homes which were in a row. They were reminiscent of yurts or hogans. Then quick as a flash, I was inside, looking at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s back. She was tall, dressed in a black robe with crystals around her head. Telepathically I knew that she was a Priestess, a Healer. The Priestess was standing before an altar of some kind. Next, a small room emanating magenta light came into view. The room was translucent; the walls, ceiling, and floor emanated this gorgeous magenta light. Another room stood beside it, emanating a beautiful clear green light. Instantly I understood that these were healing rooms and that this civilization used color for healing and balancing the body.   I found myself outside, watching women and children playing on a hill. It was a bright sunny day and the children were laughing and chatting. On the hilltop there was a white stone post and lintel with three square colors atop the lintel. The colors were tints of the primary colors of red, yellow and blue. Every now and then a boy would run under the post and lintel to stand for a few moments. Then he would zip out to play again. I understood that this structure helped boys balance their chakra energy; it helped their energy flow without hindrance. Only the boys needed it; it was not necessary for the girls to do this.   Lastly, I found myself looking at the back of an old woman who was sitting on a bench. She was contemplating an exterior mosaic or mural that covered a long low wall. I approached this very colorful abstract wall. Soft sounds emanated from it as the colors moved and fused into each other. I knew that my gross ears could not hear the extraordinary beauty of the music that was created by the fusing colors. The wall was alive, changing into different configurations of beauty, much like a kaleidoscope. The old woman had created this beautiful wall and it was she who was responsible for bringing the concept of color healing into this civilization.      I re-entered my body with a great jerk and my eyes opened. I got up from my spot on the floor and went to work in a daze. There is no way for me to put into words how life changing this event has been. Seeing this beautiful world allowed me to understand the power and healing properties of color and sound. I continue to make art that will bring beauty and healing forces into our world.

1594,OBE,1521,43,,F,"I had a two part experience with this series. I had an OBE with the first and fourth meditation. In the first meditation I experienced a dropping down into my heart. Once that happened, I felt myself leave my physical body. I found myself in the rings of Saturn. I observed this area for a bit. I could feel something like wind and could hear the planet rotating. I watched as rocky material went by. I say watched, but it wasnt like watching with your eyes. I felt like I was going in a circular motion and felt like I was standing, but not really standing. I shifted my consciousness to look down because I felt like I had moved from the rings to somewhere else. I found my consciousness in the middle of the DNA helix. It seems like I stayed there for quite awhile and could feel a sense of awe. I felt in awe throughout this whole experience. I then found myself sort of floating in what felt and looked like darkness, but not scary darkness more like space darkness. I became aware of a shape, but it was on a mammoth scale. There is nothing that I can even compare it to. It felt like God, OM, greatness. I was then in the middle of what seemed like what would be comparable to the bloodstream. I was moving very fast and saw lots of red around me. This shifted from the bloodstream to the galaxies, other planets, humans, animals, trees, everything. I felt like I was being shown that everything is connected and on an even larger scale, we make (everything) actually makes up God/OM. We are the heart, everything is about the heart. In the 4th mediation I had a similar, but different experience. I dropped down into my heart again, but I stayed there for a bit. I had the sensation that I was laying on my left side. I could hear a muffled heart beat. Not a perfect beat and it sounded as if it may even be skipping beats, but so comforting. I became aware of the feeling of warm fluid all around me and inside my nose, lungs, mouth. I could see my right hand, but it was very tiny and very pink. It was mostly dark, but a little bit of white light was around the edges of this space. I felt as if this was me and I was in my mothers womb. I remember feeling the most comforted I ever have. It was so comforting, but also very confining, but not in a bad way. From there, I felt like I was in a white light spiral. The spiral shot the purest white light through my heart and out of the crown of my head-simultaneously. My consciousness catapulted out of my chest, but also through my head. Up, straight up and fast, but completely enveloped with white light and love. I felt like there were beings that were moving with me, supporting me, but they had no physical characteristics. They were pure light.    ",,American,"25,000",spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,never,very strong,littl,"0 24,999",High,Yoga st,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult
1595,OBE,1254,42,,F,"I was listening to a Coldplay album on my iPod and looking out the window of the plane, relaxing &amp; enjoying the flight. I wasnt paying particular attention to anything and was letting my mind wander when I gradually realized that I was flying, not flying in the airplane, but flying alongside the airplane. It was a wonderful feeling, like the flying dreams that I used to have as a child. The difference was that in my childhood dreams, my body was flying and...and I was asleep. When I was on the airplane, I wasnt sleeping. What happened was that I was listening to the music and then I became aware that I was flying in spirit. That is to say, I saw my body sitting in the airplane but *I* was outside the cabin, in the air just beyond my window. I saw myself there but I wasnt afraid. The whole experience was beautiful. I could feel myself soaring. The freedom and the peace that I felt was amazing. When I first realized what was happening, I just enjoyed it but then,unfortunately, I tried to control it. I wanted to see if I could go up or down and the moment I started thinking, the experience was over and I was back in my body, sitting in the airplane, looking at the clouds outside my window.

1602,ME ,1489,56,,M," By about nine p.m. I noticed that I was hearing songs in a way I never had before. I seemed to be entering more deeply than usual into the mind of the writer and understanding what was being emotionally conveyed. So I kept listening. I felt the sorrows and joys of others as they spoke to me in song. I felt the tragic beauty in the passions, lost hopes and brevity of life as experienced by other people. There was a collision of sadness and beauty, a kind of majestic sorrow. I wondered if it was due to being fifty six years of age and being able to relate to many situations in life. Shivers repeatedly rose in waves up my spine from its base. I could not recall ever enjoying music to such an extent. I identified so closely with the singers, I became them. I could get up and go to the bathroom or get a drink of chilled water from the kitchen without losing the spinal effect. I then returned to the headphones and Yahoo Radio on the computer. The shivers of pleasure continued to rise in waves up my spine and began to intensify and surge down my legs and up my arms. The base of my head, at the rear, where the spine joins the skull was hit by waves of exquisite sensation with each new song. It felt like a hand was gripping the upper back of my neck where it meets the skull, and channelling in high voltage pleasure direct to my brain. After each wave of energy up my spine, this sensation did not totally subside, but seemed to remain as a scintillation of increased magnitude higher than the level before it. I became concerned as the euphoric physical effects intensified and extended in duration. I checked my pulse by the clock to see if I had an elevated heart rate associated with panic attacks. My pulse was normal and steady and my body felt very, very relaxed. I had the sensation of settling or falling back, deeper within my body, as the experience continued. My mind was paradoxically calm, intensely present, sharply aware and my cognition totally functioning and nimble. The waves of sensation up my spine became a volcanic rush that entered my head. I was thinking \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Oh, Oh! Awesome! Go with it!\xe2\x80\x9d Rivers of energy flowed outwards along my limbs. By now it was after midnight. My body felt almost weightless. I felt immense power flowing through my body. At one point I looked at my hands and they felt so full of the sensation of energy and so insubstantial that I wondered if they might pass through the wall if I tried. I touched the wall out of curiosity and my hand was certainly still solid as it touched the wall! It was just that I could not feel my hand. It went on and on, hour after hour as powerful waves of surging energy, ever intensifying. I was totally immersed in intense ecstasy. Suddenly, there was another huge rush of energy upwards. There was complete darkness. I found my locus of consciousness now resting in the centre of my head as a tiny pin point. The room I was sitting in had totally disappeared from sight. It was dark and comforting in the centre of my brain. Then, there was a final atomic eruption I could feel rising beneath this tiny \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d, my centre of total awareness, and it burst forth from the top of my head carrying that tiny point in a massive torrent of energy that felt like a clear, cool viscous liquid, and my awareness emerged into a infinite yet intimate space which was like an endless ocean where I felt connected to all things in the cosmos. I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! I must have died! Oh well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d I had no fear. I was merely a point of consciousness with no body at all. I was overcome with immense gratitude for the privilege of having been alive, and for my life with its joys as well as its sorrows and the total improbability of just being. I thanked God.  Following on was an instantaneous, total life review. It was like viewing a three hundred and sixty degree panoramic picture screen with all of my life events played out simultaneously. Many of the things I had thought very significant in my life were not at all important. My preconceptions of right and wrong melted away. I did not feel judged in any way, I felt completely accepted. Everything was meaningful in my life and nothing I had experienced was wasted. The only things that now mattered in my past life were the times I had shown loving compassion to other people and living things. Then I felt enormous, limitless, feelings of joy, love, compassion and empathy for humankind and all living things. I felt intimate kinship with all humanity.

1604,DEE,1295,5,,F,"I was about 5 years old. I was going through emotional trauma because my parents were divorcing and my beloved father had suddenly, without warning to me, and permanently left our home, leaving me to fend for myself with my withdrawn, unaffectionate mother and my older sister who hated me. One day I was leaving our 6th floor apartment to visit a friendly neighbor. I opened the front door but I stood on the threshold and couldnt go any further. I looked down the long dark hallway but I couldnt take a step off the threshold and out onto the hallway floor. Even though I walked down this dark hallway many, many times before, on that day I couldnt move. I was physically paralyzed. I tried to turn around to go back into my house but I just stood there unable to move. I couldnt move in any direction. My mind wanted to move but I couldnt get my body to move. Then a strange thing happened. I saw an ethereal mist surround me in the shape of a cocoon and it began to wrap itself around me, starting at my feet, going up and stopping at my neck. My whole body, including my arms, was wrapped in this mummy-like cocoon. It made me feel safe, protected and warm. It calmed me down. Then I got an idea how to break out of the paralysis. I suddenly put out my arms and began to twirl off the threshold. I twirled and twirled all the way down the long hallway. I remember my twirling became a habit because I was twirling in my home, in the hallways and in the streets. I thought I was dancing. I think that people thought I was dancing.

1606,NDE,1078,25,,M,"After the mask was placed on my face, the doctor told me to count backwards from 10. I began to count. When I got to 1, I realized I couldnt breathe. I also could not speak or move...or open my eyes.  I began to panic inside. I thought..Im going to die!  Immediately I started to try and think of something that would help me stay alive. Trapped inside my body and unable to move or speak, there werent many options. I thought that if I could just hold onto a thought with my mind, I would not die. So, I thought of a tree. I pictured a tree in my mind, imagined how it felt to be next to a tree, and kept repeating the word tree over and over.  I began to feel like I was moving through a dark tunnel. I felt afraid...and clung to my inner tree life rope as I moved along the dark passageway.  I moved through a darkness...murkiness... that included spirit like beings roaming around making some sounds... I did not recognize any of them...they were misty, grey entities floating around. I felt fear. I realized I could no longer see the word for tree in my mind...but I could still see the tree, and feel its presence.  I continued to move through the darkness and the spirits were gone. The tunnel was lighter. I had an instant awareness of my whole life...like a 360 degree view of everything about my life. It was extremely expansive knowing and deep knowledge. I no longer felt afraid. And I could no longer see the tree in my mind, but I could feel its presence. I was aware that there was a place I had traveled from...and I had family there... but I was not worried because I also knew that in the scheme of all I suddenly knew...all I was remembering had been just a flicker of time...my whole life had happened in less than a snap of my finger.  The light in the tunnel grew brighter and closer. I was travelling fast. Suddenly I burst though into a sea of Light...only Light.... I no longer felt the presence of the tree, because I realized I am the tree! I am everything! This was not a thought...but a knowing. An all expansive knowing.  The feeling was completely ecstatic...like an orgasm without a body. No body to limit the deep and ongoing BLISS. There were no words... just knowing. The knowing was The only thing that matters is Love... all Love It was timeless and so pure. The direct experience of Divine Love Then I became aware of something forming... like a vibration. I realized it was a thought coming into form... and the thought was: What about my son? (I had a 5 month old son at home) As soon as the vibration became a thought, I immediately began travelling back through the tunnel... fast!  I woke up in the recovery room.  I didnt tell anyone for 5 years....not even my husband.  The experience has profoundly changed my life... The experience memory has never faded...it is still more real than real.

1608,OBE,1373,39,,F,"I copy here the experience exactly as I typed it then. This records my third experience. The first one occurred in February of 1984 and then August, 1984. The third one in January of 1985, as written.  Jan.26, 1985--it has happened again (On what I experienced in early morning, only half awake). There was a rushing sound, a roaring in my ears. I am half awake now, with consciousness of my surroundings, and also have the feeling I am about to plunge off a cliff, a falling sensation. I feel, just briefly, a sense of immovability--the way in a dream one tries to move and cant, and also a sense of fear arises at this. Then the images begin, the feeling one of plunging deep into a vortex, but everything is vividly clear, in color. The images are against a black background, and they are perfect crystalline forms, changing constantly, that make me think of snowflake forms at times, then of those theoretical models of chemical components or DNA, and then of pure rock crystal forms. The speed of the images is way beyond me, their transformations occurring without cessation. Nothing exists but this silent world I seem to have entered, as the forms recede and accelerate alternately in the darkness. Then they stop--disappear, and what I see at a vast distance in total blackness, as if I were looking through a telescope backwards, only infinitely smaller than that, is a tiny circle of light. I see it as if I am looking into a cauldron of light, barely glimpsed at such a distance, but it shifts and flickers on the edges. Only a tiny part of it is revealed to me, but the light is so clear it is like the interior of a diamond--a dazzling light, that oddly conveys a sense, for which I cannot account, that it has a knowledge of some sort--as if the light was source. Then a tingling feeling occurs and the image ends--it all goes away, and I sense my regular surroundings again. I try to go to sleep. The first time this happened, last February 84, I was scared silly.  The images occurred after I experienced the same roaring sound, but at that time (also an early hour, between 2 and 5 a.m.) there was also a loud cracking sound; in fact, that happened first. The images were, then, not immediately visible. They appeared finally in the center of a deep blackness at a great distance in a curling, churning fire of light, and accelerated toward me until I could see the swirling changing crystal forms. I stayed up an hour afterwards, writing it down. I felt then the same tingling sensation at the onset and end of the event, and the same moment of immovability. The second time (all told, it has happened three times) was last summer, August, 84. And now this one, around 4:30 or 5 a.m. The fear was briefer; I knew more of what to expect, and it was as if I willed myself to hold on. I had been asleep, wake up to the buzzing, electric sensation, and the rest, and then it begins. I let the images come. In the times between the 3 events Ive tried to make it happen, unsuccessfully. Each time has occurred only spontaneously. Each time I feel I have encountered something with great energy or power within it. I feel it will happen again--that there is more to learn. Especially within that light. It frightens me, yet I sense it has meaning, validity. I wonder at its meaning, and seek it out.

1614,NDE,1098,37,,F," I started drifting off and could only vaguely hear them now.  I found myself floating down a long tunnel. I looked all around and was aware of a soft and mesmerizing light at the end. I wanted to rush towards it but found it hard to move forward and could do so only by forcing myself forward half swimming, half walking. Then, I heard a distant faint voice cry out \xe2\x80\x9cSinus rhythm collapsing, we are losing her\xe2\x80\x9d but I felt completely disinterested in this. Who was being lost? I did not know who they were talking about and was annoyed at the interruption. Now I only had eyes for the wonderful glowing light at the end of the tunnel which seemed to hold promise of great warmth and love unending. I felt so joyful and excited and all awareness of my body on the bed left me as I tried for some time to reach the light. I knew absolutely that wonderful things were awaiting, if I could only get to the end of the tunnel. The light now loomed larger and I could see faint outlines of figures waiting there, beckoning me forwards. I wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is waiting there, is it Sai Baba, angels or loved ones?\xe2\x80\x9d I tried harder and harder to reach the end of the tunnel.  Then, a very faint voice interrupted my travels with a tiny urgent \xe2\x80\x9cBaby on Board\xe2\x80\x9d and a pleading \xe2\x80\x9cBreathe! You must breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. (A nurse was apparently shouting loudly into my ear). This caught my attention. I stopped in the middle of the tunnel and wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho has a baby on board, who should be breathing?\xe2\x80\x9d And then thought \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is me, perhaps I am pregnant, if I am, then I must go back\xe2\x80\x9d and I turned reluctantly around. It was so hard to leave that wonderful promise of all-encompassing Love and Joy waiting in the Light and those light filled beings waiting there. The return down the tunnel was brutally sudden. I came back to consciousness to experience total chaos, doctors were shouting and my whole body was in pain. I felt icy cold, but I could see I was indeed pregnant. My memories flooded back and I knew I had many children and others who needed me to hold on. I fought to come back and although the heart rhythm was still unstable, immediately went into labour. Serious faced heart specialists told me \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t have the baby yet, we will deliver in two weeks when your heart has settled down\xe2\x80\x9d. I did not argue, I could see their point, but I knew from my previous eight deliveries that this labour was not a trial run. So exhausted, I steeled myself for a long night. Whether it was the right time or not, this baby was on its way. I was informed later that day, that I had flat lined for some time and that had this episode happened at our house, some one hours drive from the nearest hospital, both William and I would have died. I reflected on that urgent message in the morning, no wonder I had to get to hospital that day. How strange the many delays that had led to the nurse colliding with the heart specialist! I realized that I had been somehow protected all the way through this crisis. I also felt enormous gratitude for the nurse who had shouted in my ear, because I realized that I had only turned back because of her prompting as all knowledge of my present life had been wiped out. At dawn the following morning with labour well advanced, a grim faced team of Heart specialists and surgeons gathered to deliver the baby. I was hooked to a bank of heart monitors, and had needles in my feet, arms and hands. The recalcitrant heart was still racing and wobbling around. Their ominous expressions told me that they didnt give much for our chances under anaesthetic.   Would you like to leave any messages? I was asked. None, I replied. My husband and children knew I loved them, I told them that every day. Since seeing the two little boys standing together on that planet four years earlier in the OOBE, I felt sure that William at least, would survive to be with his brother. As the anesthetic took hold, I felt totally at peace, after all I had come close to the Light and it was so wonderful, I had no fear of death left. William was delivered with only minor difficulties apparently unharmed by his pre-natal adventure in the Star Trek ship!

1617,DEE,1305,55,,F,"One day when I was 55, my spiritual life shifted into a new direction. This is a funny and ironic story. I was shopping alone in my local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, buying stuff and yet another set of bed linens because I didnt have that particular shade of beige. I suddenly stopped walking and looked down at all the stuff in my cart and felt a longing. I thought to myself, Is this it? Is this all there is to life? That Peggy Lee song came into my head: Is That All There Is? I just stood there, in that store, staring at all my stuff in the cart, and feeling a strong yearning to find a deeper meaning to life. I wasnt thinking to find God yet. I just wanted to know a deeper meaning to life. I couldnt believe that life was just about cooking dinners, buying bed linens and sending people greeting cards. I didnt realize then that I wanted to find God. The funny and ironic part of this story is that God planted this second seed (the first seed had to do with Rose Kennedys face, which Ill submit soon) at the store called Bed, Bath and BEYOND. A girlfriend brought this irony to my attention, which I didnt get at the time of the STE. At the moment that my STE occurred, I told myself that I was going to find a deeper meaning in life.

1620,ME ,1302,51,,F,"Sometime in 1996, I was sitting alone in my office in my home in the middle of writing my memoir novel. I was sitting in my chair, thinking at the time. Suddenly I saw a vision in my head that Im entitling Our Human Timeline of Existence. It was a horizontally long image running left to right in my head. There were no words, numbers or sounds, only images. At the left of this horizontal Timeline was the first image. That image was of an ape down on all fours and facing left. To the right of that ape and facing right was a second ape starting to stand up. To the right of that ape and facing right was the third ape, looking Neanderthal. To the right of that ape was a picture of a human being facing right. Then there was a little space. To the right of the space was the image of Leonardo da Vinci\xe2\x80\x99s Vitruvian Man. To the right of that was a very, very long empty area. At the right end of the Timeline, the last image, is a great gust of horizontal wind blurring out the whole right end of the Timeline. That was what I saw. There were no dates on this Timeline. I thought about that vision and why I was seeing it. According to the spacing of the images one to another on the left and then the very long empty space in the middle area and then the wind blur all the way on the right, the vision said to me that, according to where Vitruvian Man was standing in the Timeline, we humans are currently (the 20th Century) into about 20% of our survival, from our beginnings on Earth to our end. I couldnt see our end because that was where the horizontal wind blur was, which took up all the space on the right side. There were no dates, so I dont know how it would happen to us, when, or if it would even happen at all. What I do see is that we humans have many, many more millenniums of survival. I believe I saw this vision and I believe (kinda) in what it was telling me. I wasnt sure what I was supposed to do with this knowledge except to tell people. But since that was one of my first spiritual experiences, I was so new to God (but still an atheist), that I think I told one other person. I wasnt confident in what I saw and I didnt want people to think I was crazy. Im uploading a file of the picture I drew of this vision. I dont remember what day I actually saw it because I wasnt writing down my spiritual experiences yet. So I recorded my vision in this picture at a later time, June 19, 2006.

1621,DEE,1299,22,,M,"I entered my bedroom, sat down on a cushioned window seat, and the sobbing continued. Moments later, I felt a tingling in my arms, kind of like they had fallen asleep, though I wasnt sitting in a way that impaired blood flow. Moments later, my arms rose from my sides and my hands literally came together in prayer in front of my chest. I watched in complete wonderment as this occurred. And I suddenly felt in my heart a very clear instruction that I needed to get on my knees and pray. But I was refused. I didnt understand why prayer was necessary. In fact, it seemed like an act of subservience that made me uneasy. Meanwhile, my arms and hands were literally vibrating, and my hands were stuck together that literally, I was unable to pull them apart. Why is this happening to me, I wondered. And I suddenly understood that I was dying. No sooner did that thought cross my mind, my hands fell back to my sides--thus making a connection in my mind between the thought I was dying and the release of my hands from the unseen force, and the immediate cessation of the tingling sensations. Given how strange this all was, it seemed perfectly logical to me that I was indeed dying. My mother was spiritual, so I thought I better go downstairs and tell her. In the living room, I sat beside my mother and told her what had just happened. She told me to go ahead and pray. I told her I couldnt, and that I was dying. She was very spiritual. When she heard this, she thought perhaps a part of me was dying, to make room for something else... but I wasnt physically dying. I told her she was wrong. She checked my temperature. I had a fever of 103. She went to get some aspirin, and told me to to relax. After I took the aspirin, I lay down on the living room couch, and thats when a spiritual being showed up. I heard him as clear as day, talking in my head, just as if he was in the room with me. The first thing he said to me was, Ok, lets go! When he said that, I could feel a pulling sensation all of a sudden on the region of my solar plexus. If the soul was real, it felt like he was reaching in and pulling my soul out of my body. It was a very uncomfortable and unusual feeling, and I reacted to it by kicking my feet on the couch. When I did this, the pulling, or suction-y feeling stopped. Long story short, this fight to stay went on for more than an hour. I remained lucid throughout the whole experience, conversing with my family while also telepathically conversing with this Being. The longer I resisted, the more this Being resorted to threatening me. I didnt care--no matter what the threats (Stay and youll be crazy, no one will ever understand you, your family wont remember a thing--their memories will be wiped) I refused to go wherever it was this Being was intent on taking me. Finally, fed up with my refusal, the Being told me he wasnt leaving empty handed. If I didnt come then and there, he would cause my father to have a massive heart attack, and he would take my father. My father and I had had a long and stormy relationship, however, I didnt have to think about that threat. I immediately relented and agreed to come. But I asked to say goodbye to my family first--which he permitted. I literally kissed and hugged everyone who was there and said goodbye. It was the saddest moment I have ever experienced. Then I told the Being I was finally ready, and I heard a voice (a different voice than the Being) tell me it wasnt my time. For a while I pleaded to go. I was ready. But it was no use. My fever broke, and I felt better than I had ever felt in my life-- and I appreciated my life like I had never appreciated it before.

I told Shawn that it felt like an answer from God and it was so strange. The next morning Shawn went out to our car that was parked on the street. He heard muffled music playing that grew louder as he got nearer. When he opened the car door the radio was blasting music very loud on my brothers favourite radio station. When Shawn tried to shut the radio off, it would not turn off, he had to pull the system out of its dock to make it turn off. The radio remained like that for years. The wires were fried because that night our building and our car was hit by lightening, the very lightening that crashed outside our window at the very moment I asked God for a sign / for proof that John was okay. That isnt the end of it. From then on it was like the floodgates had opened. I got all kinds of signs from John, all kinds of instances of after-death communication, including a full apparition, physical phenomenon, electronic phenomenon and I would like to share that all here. I could write my own book about all the signs John gave me and my family after his death. He loved us so much his love transcended death and the tragedy of his loss made it that much more important that he get through to us and let us know he was okay. And God made it possible for him to do that.

1651,DEE,1541,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

1652,DEE,1297,67,,F,"Hank, my husband, and I were getting ready to move on December 10, 2012 from Ossining, New York to Milford, Connecticut. Most of the house was already packed up. I had gone through the whole coat closet downstairs by the front door, throwing stuff out and organizing what I wanted to pack up at that time or wait until moving day. There was a small shelf above the coat hangar bar that I looked over while standing on a stool to see what was up there and what needed to be thrown out. There were mostly gloves and hats which I kept there in case we needed them. We had just arrived home at night from eating out Thanksgiving Dinner on November 22, 2012. Hank hung up his coat first in the lit up coat closet. Then I took out a hangar, hung my coat on it and, while looking toward Hank and talking to him, I went to hang up my coat without looking at the bar or what I was doing because I knew that closet so well, after living in this house for 22 years. I had trouble getting the hangar hook to go over the bar. I tried and tried but the hook wouldnt go on the bar. It kept getting stuck on something. So I looked at the bar and saw there was a chain of some kind hanging down from the shelf above. There was a sliver of an opening between the slats of the wooden shelf and a chain had made its way through the opening and hung down in a loop, the narrow opening of which happened to be facing the tip of the hangar. So when I aimed, without looking, the tip of the hangar to go on the bar, it went through the narrow loop instead and got stuck there. I looked at the chain. I couldnt understand where this chain came from. I knew everything that was on the shelf and there was no chain. I pulled on the chain. It came down through the slat opening and a medallion of some kind followed it. I looked at this medallion with its long neck chain in the palm of my hand and just stared at it. I couldnt believe my eyes. That was my medallion and my chain that I had mysteriously lost 5 years previous. I had this piece of jewelry custom made for me, based on the image that I had seen when I was 29 years of age of a glow and cross. The medallion was a white Mother of Pearl flat, round disk (glow) with a MOP cross affixed onto the disk. When I received this gift to myself from the jeweler, I loved it and wore it every single day for about a year. One night Hank and I were going to a special place and I wanted to wear a special necklace that would conflict with the medallion and chain, so I took it off and probably placed it on my dresser in the bedroom, as I was planning to wear it again the next day. I either placed it on the top of my dresser or put it into my jewelry drawer in the dresser. The next day when I awoke, I looked for the medallion to put it on again and I couldnt find it. I looked on the dresser top, in all the drawers, on the floor around the dresser, in our bedroom, in the bathrooms and in all the rooms of my home, but Hank and I couldnt find it. It was missing for about 5 years and during those years, I kept on looking all over my house for the medallion, but with no luck. Then I thought that God was mad at me for taking it off, so It took it away. So, 5 years later, God had miraculously given back to me my medallion in such an incredible way. I showed it to Hank in disbelief. He was amazed how that medallion came back to me, and 5 years later! Then I told Hank that I had a bad thought, that It gave it back to me because something bad or hard was going to happen during or after our move and I would need this medallion that I loved so much and which connected me to God and Its serenity. Ive been wearing the medallion every day since and will wear it every single day always, even if it doesnt go with a fancy outfit. Our move was hard but Hank and I survived it and are doing well. Although we have to move again in a year and dont know where we will live, though we want to stay in Milford.

1655,ME ,1287,57,,F,"On January 12, 2002 something pivotal happened that enabled me to open my mind to believe in God. My husband Hank and I were staying at a historic, antique-filled bed and breakfast, Butternut Farm, in Glastonbury, Connecticut. (I dont think the owners of this establishment would want it to be made public that their bed and breakfast is haunted.) It was Saturday night and we went to sleep on the comfortable and luxurious bed. In the middle of the night, I woke up, eyes wide open, and sat up tall in bed. Looking back on this experience, I must have looked like I was in one of those movies when someone is under a spell and rises from their sleep with their eyes wide open, back straight as a board. I didnt hear or smell anything and I wasnt touched by anything but I instantly turned my head to the left and saw something. About three feet away from me, suspended in mid air about eye level to me, was a ghost. The ghost was shaped like a huge, round, horizontal Bayer aspirin tablet. It was flat on the top and bottom with rounded edges. It was about two feet in diameter. The ghost was made up of thousands of tiny black particles, each shaped like a sperm, which furiously rotated clockwise as fast as a tornado. It spun around so violently that it spewed off some of the tiny black particles. But, although the ghost was just a couple of feet away and although it was spinning as fast as a tornado, I didnt feel a breeze and none of the particles touched me. It was as if the ghost was contained in its own little world, separate from my human world. This whole experience actually lasted just a few seconds, because as soon as I sat up and turned my head and my eyes saw the ghost, as if it saw me looking at it, it instantly broke down into an amoebic mob of black particles and made a mad dash for the closed old door and disappeared through the long crack of the warped frame. I sat up for a while thinking about this experience. Strangely, I did not feel fear because if I did, I would have awakened my husband. I did feel a sort of fear because I didnt want to put my head back down on the pillow, afraid to go back to sleep, afraid the ghost would return. But I was very tired and layed back down to ponder what I should do. The next thing I knew, it was morning. As soon as we woke up, I told Hank about the ghost. He just listened to me. He looked like he was believing me. I told him there probably was a small chance it was all a dream but I didnt think so. It didnt feel like a dream. It felt real and I remembered it in vivid detail. When we went downstairs for breakfast, I was so excited that I told everyone in the dining room what happened to me that night. The two owners mockingly pooh-poohed my story but there was a visiting pastor from Pennsylvania. She also stayed overnight because she was to give a sermon at a nearby church. She confirmed that she was also visited by the ghost. She said she didnt see what I saw but she woke up during the night and felt its presence sitting in a chair by her bed. She said that in her line of work, people often came to her with stories and issues concerning ghosts and spirits. With the pastor as witness, I was validated 100% that I did indeed see a ghost. Actually, I think this pastor was an Angel because in the days ahead I tried to reach her but I couldnt find her anywhere, even though she gave me her business card. It was as if she disappeared. Seeing the ghost was a shocking but crucial experience. It had served a greater purpose in my life than just to amaze me. It took about a year for me to digest and process the ghost before I could tell anyone else. Then I told a friend. After getting this experience out, I started to really think about the ghost. It suddenly dawned on me that I saw a ghost! The reality of seeing a ghost, I realized, became proof that there really was a spiritual world. Standing now on the threshold of this whole new world, my mind looked out and wondered: Wow! Now that I know there really is a spiritual world and that ghosts are real, what else can I believe in? The answer came in my very next breath: God. But, still, I didnt find God for another year. And on that day, everything became crystal clear.

1656,ME ,1545,62,,M,"I had just arrived at the hotel and decided to take a little nap, to rest after the driving. I left a lamp on, and lied on the bed, half turned to the right and fell asleep. It was a light and pleasant sleep and I awoke after about half an hour. As I opened my eyes, I saw a kind of steam or smoke rising from me. It was more like enveloping me, because as I was still half-turned to the right I saw it was rising from below the side of the bed. It was rising fast, as fast as steam does from a boiling pan of water, but more smoothly. I observed this and the next instant I became a little anxious, because I remembered that something like a haze rises sometimes from people who are dying. So I immediately breathed in and checked my body mentally, but I was fine. But by then I could not see the steam any more. I have to say that as I woke up I was very clear and knew exactly where I was, and when.

All there is was the sudden realization that I exist. As I float, I can see earth getting closer. I start to fall through the atmosphere, the clouds, etc. but the experience is not frightening at all. I see things start to form on the ground, like roadways and towns. I see what would be my small town, circle terrace, the top of a bunch of houses, etc. as I continue my downward movement. Just as I get ready to hit the roof of our house, my eyes open in my bedroom.

1693,DEE,1368,41,,F,I had just settled into bed for approx. 15 minutes. My eyes were closed but I was awake. I saw a circle of bright light in the air. There was a male figure behind the light but I do not know who. The light started to dance in a circle. I watched in amazement yet my eyes were still closed. The circle of light began to move. This was my confirmation that I was awake and not dreaming or imagining as my mind went right into I wonder where it is going to go. I was anxious to see where the dancing circle of bright light was moving to. I watched intently. The light moved through my hand that was resting on my husbands stomach/chest and entered into my husband. I was awestruck and began to weep tears of (joy) for a lack of term. I did not tell my husband what I had experienced. The next day we had a scheduled appointment with a marriage counselor. The counselor started as always with Gene how do you feel. His answer confirmed what I had saw the night before. Gene ALWAYS would answer with fine or good. This time is answer was I feel more spiritual.

1694,NDA,1386,17,,F,"One night, I had a dream. I remember being outside of my grandfather house. Outside of the house was my grandfather. He approached me, and we were happy to see each other. I knew it had been a while since I saw him. And, I also knew that she was currently sick and afraid of him leaving me [to the afterlife]. My grandfather took my hand, and we walked into his house. The view inside the house, during the dream, was identical to his real house. What I found unusual was that all the lights were out except the one straight ahead- his room.  As we proceeded to walk towards his room, he was telling me that things were going to be fine. That, at first, things were going to feel like they are spinning out of control. As if I was standing with my arms out, spinning in circles, losing my balance- THAT type of loss of control. Although I found comfort in his words, I didnt know what he actually meant, until after his death.  When we approached the bedroom door, I could not believe my eyes. In front of me, was a hospital bed and my grandfather was in it! My grandfather was in his bed, facing my direction; he was asleep. Behind him, sitting, was his 2nd wife, his daughter, Lucy, and his son, Danny. To my left [and my grandfathers], sitting on a chair, was my mother. All of them were looking straight at my grandfather. I could not believe that I was in the presence of two grandfathers- and the same one!!  Seeing my grandfather in the hospital bed created a magnetic pull. I could not remove my eyes from him. I had never seen him in such a state. He was always alert, active, and immediately greeting me. This was the first time that I ever saw him so disconnected from everyone else, especially in their presence.  Seeing that there was an empty chair right next to his bed, I immediately sat on it. I felt I was trying to be close to him as I possibly could. This was the man I had loved all my life. He was my father, my comfort, and my strength. I admired this man profusely. And, knowing that I had denied seeing him for so many months, he needed to know I was finally there.  I apologized to him for not being there for when he needed me the most. I told him I was scared of losing him and I was scared that he would pass away once he already saw me. (He had seen every family member, but me. Due to how our relationship was, my withdrawal had shocked everyone. I thought you loved your grandfather, why arent you seeing him? You know that he is dying. Go see him.) Once I finished venting to my grandfather, asking him for forgiveness, his eyes opened. He looked at me. I returned the look. And he closed them again. Right then I knew that I was right. He WAS waiting for me. He wasnt leaving yet because we hadnt said goodbye. And I was the last person that he needed to see. But, I knew that I wasnt ready to let him go. Feeling overwhelmed, I reached out to him. I went for his hand and I grabbed it. It was my first touch with him in months. And once I held his hand, I heard his last breath. I was then informed he died. Everyone around was crying, including myself. With the pain of a broken heart, and having everything feel so real, I immediately woke up from my dream. I woke up sweating and bursting into tears. I could not stop crying. I had felt as if my grandfather had truly passed away.  My mother, who was sleeping next to me at the time (she didnt want to be alone during this moment in her life- being a daddys girl) woke up with fright. She didnt know what happened to me. I relived the dream by telling her every single detail. She reached out to a relative who informed her that my grandfather was still alive. - Exactly one week later, still fearful of my dream, and still avoiding seeing my dying grandfather, my mom informed me that she had just seen my grandfather. She informed me that now it was just a matter of hours or minutes. Without thinking, I immediately got ready. It was probably 10:00-11:00 at night. On my way over there, those fears werent present. But once I walked up to my grandfathers door- all my fears came flooding back. I did not know what to expect. Was my dream just a dream? Or, would it become a reality?? As my mother and I walked in through the door. My heart slumped to the bottom of my stomach. Just like my dream- the house was dark except for the back room- my grandfathers room. I began to experience anxiety. I was praying my steps towards the room would be nothing like my dream. I had so much hope in those few seconds which felt like an hour. When I walked into the bedroom, there he was: my grandfather laying on a bed, facing my direction. Behind him, my 2nd wife, my aunt Lucy, and my uncle Danny. My mother took a seat to my left. And I, I was offered the empty seat next to him. The seat from my dreams!  I had so many thoughts come up.

1696,ME ,1284,36,,F,"Synchronicity \xe2\x80\x93 This is my calling\xe2\x80\xa6Why the mental health system is antiquated, and why we need to stop pretending we\xe2\x80\x99re robots in a naturally spiritual world. After years of searching for my life purpose it was handed to me on a plate, quite literally from the Universe straight into my head, like a light bulb suddenly being switched on in a deep dark cave of confusion. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t lose me here, you may be thinking: \xe2\x80\x98so who are you and what do you know about re-evaluating the conceptual framework around mental illness or achieving universal peace?\xe2\x80\x99 That is exactly what I thought when the information came to me; I am no Professor or academic guru. That is the point, this has nothing to do with who I am, I have been given this message to prove that anybody of any intellect or social standing can tap into the psychic realm and see a universal truth; all you have to do is ask the question and then believe in the answer.  I have been told by spirit that the mental health system in our Western society desperately needs modifying in terms of spiritual experience. Mental distress is actually a fallacy of modern society which is ever increasing in line with consumerism and will continue to do so unless we acknowledge the problems we are creating. We must see mental distress of any kind with new eyes if human evolution is going to continue in the way it is meant. Mental distress originates in fear, a fear lodged in our past that we carry with us into the present, and project into the future, a destructive fear from which we can be free, individually, and so, universally. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s the irony:My fear of speaking out about this message and how it came to me \xe2\x80\x93 the message that it is fear that stops mankind achieving mental wellbeing, happiness and fundamentally Universal peace \xe2\x80\x93 nearly stopped me from following my path, after years of searching! I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that I\xe2\x80\x99m not still scared, but what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were to tell everyone they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be scared, if I were too afraid to put my head above the parapet and risk being shot at? Before I had my \xe2\x80\x98experience\xe2\x80\x99 I knew nothing about spirituality, and even less about religion. So what happened was as incredulous to me as what you are going to read may sound to you! I have, however, always had good intuition and a kind of underlying \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 since childhood that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching for something that was missing, like I always knew there was another dimension even though society and my education told me otherwise. I was about 12 when I read the book \xe2\x80\x98Utopia\xe2\x80\x99 and to me it was more than just fiction, it was a possibility. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t just think it\xe2\x80\x99s achievable; I know how. It all happened when I had started to meditate at the same time as thinking more deeply about what to be \xe2\x80\x98mentally ill\xe2\x80\x99 actually means. I\xe2\x80\x99d worked within the field for long enough to know about academic theory; the nature / nurture argument and chemical imbalances. What was the truth? I started to question my own sanity, I have always been very sensitive and emotional; where do you draw the line? I am well aware that by writing this, that by voicing my beliefs that I have channelled a message from the spiritual realm, I could be seen by some working within the mental health field as being deluded or having experienced a psychotic episode. You may choose to believe that this is the rambling of an unstable mind, you may suggest that what I am saying is insane. I, however, now know that the real insanity would be for me to ignore such an important message. If I were to ignore it and deny myself my truth for fear of speaking out against a system, I know that I would become mentally distressed \xe2\x80\x93 and that is also proof enough for me to know that the message I have been given is the truth. Many people who try to speak out about their psychic experiences are told that what they are experiencing is not real; that they are \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99. So either way, if somebody has a spiritual experience they are more than likely doomed to some form of mental distress, predominantly not from the experience itself, but from either repressing it due to fear, or from believing they are going \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99 if they do dare to speak out because they are told that what is happening to them isn\xe2\x80\x99t real. The message I was given confirmed all of this. So I had been contemplating the true nature of mental illness, and whether indeed I was mentally unwell, and my brain went into overload so I decided I needed to try to relax.

1709,NDE,1138,34,,F,"As I pondered my situation, I slowly became aware of overwhelming feelings of peace, love, acceptance, and certain knowledge of perfection and purpose. I felt great awe. It quickly became clear to me that the light was the ultimate intellect, love, and creative force. The psychological environment in which I now existed literally permeated around and through me. I knew that Light knew my every nuance, every thought, and every deed. Amazingly, it still loved me, even viewed me with a certain sense of delighted humor. In an odd way the Light was part of me. Yet it was also everything else. As I easily, and happily, settled into this new environment I realized that time and space were very different than what I was used to. I could follow multiple trains of thought and experience in what seemed to be a simultaneous manner. It was akin to how we use time in dreams in that numerous situations were playing out in \xe2\x80\x98no time\xe2\x80\x99. I was luxuriating in the perfection of the situation, while simultaneously making mental notes of my surroundings. At the same time, Light was addressing me thru telepathy and instilling within me what I later called scrolls of knowledge. These scrolls unraveled and revealed information about the true nature of reality. I think that the figurative scrolls were thought forms that existed within Light and Light was mentally pushing them onto my consciousness. I had no idea what they meant, as the ideas and knowledge contained within was light years more complex than I could grasp. I sensed the periphery and intent of the scrolls and knew that it would take eternity to sort it all out. Still, the bit I could sort out made it clear that in the physical dimension we are capable of experience far beyond what we ever imagined. Prior to the NDE I had experienced three enormously frightening out-of-bodies. Frightening because I \xe2\x80\x98caught myself\xe2\x80\x99 in the upper corner of the ceiling, watching myself sleep on each occasion. I did not know what was happening. I had never heard of an out-of-body experience. Now I knew, clearly, that the out-of-bodies were normal, and just the tip of the iceberg of what humans could and should experience. I received, thru telepathically transmitted images and thoughts, a glimpse of the fully developed multi-dimensional being. As I floated within Light, numerous paths of information were being delivered to me. I felt peaceful, and perfect. Suddenly I heard a deep male voice say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go back?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBack?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cback to where?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to go back, concentrate on that noise\xe2\x80\x9d, it said. My thought was NO; I do not want to go anywhere! The thought of leaving this new, yet strangely familiar, environment seemed a travesty. Still for some reason I turned my attention slightly to the left. Far away, as if thru a long train tunnel, I heard a faint noise. As I listened more intently, it got louder. I realized it was my beloved husband Ed. He was screaming my name. The next thing I knew, I was coming to consciousness in my bed. After returning to physicality I felt very lethargic and drifted off to sleep. The NDE remained clear in my mind. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it was, having never heard of an NDE, but I knew it was real. The next day Ed phoned me at work and said he had scheduled an appointment with my doctor, and was coming over to take me to it. At the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office he said I had been having some sort of seizure that did not involve convulsions. It was more like a dead person. He said my body had seized up like it was frozen and my eyes had rolled back in my head. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me until now, as he did not want to scare me.

First, you should know that I am a petite female (52, very slender). But in my meditation, all of the sudden I was sitting on a horse and it was sometime around the 10th or 12th century. I was a large man. I could feel my heft. I was wearing a helmet and some kind of armor and vest that had a chain design of some sort. It was heavy.  I had just returned from war. I was going home to my wife and children. I was sitting on my horse, on a hill, looking down at the house towards the right. It was a very long single story house that had a series of very small windows that ran horizontally across the house, and it had a dark roof that looked like it was made of straw or some textured material. It was a dark color and I could see lights from candles inside the house. I knew my wife and children were in there, waiting for my return. I sat and looked at the house and had a feeling of sadness. I was happy to be home but I felt that this life was so hard, war was so hard. It was just a feeling of life being a burden, and feeling sad about all of it. The house was down towards my right, below the hill, and if I looked to my left I could see a harbor which is where I had some from. There were boats. I remember that it was very cold. And I remember that I could feel my heft. Like I could actually feel what it felt like to be that large. I knew what the name of the harbor was. Then all of the sudden I was standing on something that is hard to describe it was like a wooden platform or large wood cart with wheels and it was being pulled by horses. I was standing on it and holding the reigns while the horses pulled this thing I was standing on. We were entering a castle. I worked at the castle. I was some kind of fighter. And then I came up out of my meditation.

1715,DEE,1540,47,,F,"I lost my father to lung cancer in December 2015. My dad was one of the two people I love more in the world. The experience was tearing, painful beyond words, also due the feeling of being abandoned in the hospice with my dad by the rest of the family, who I felt like they just wanted to get it done and over with. I have never felt more lost, alone and helpless in my life and I could not understand how this could be happening to a loving person like my dad. About 6 months later something very unique happened to me and I still can not make sense of it. I know I had been thinking about my dad that morning, desperately asking him to let me know if he was ok, like I was doing almost every day. I was standing in front of the mirror getting ready for work when I realized that I could see clearly only directly in front of me, while to both sides reality appeared to be melting into some sort of vertical waves. I had the strong feeling of some sort of presence, but at the same time I was getting increasingly scared that something was seriously wrong with me. The experience must have lasted more than 20 seconds, but this is just a guess. As I turned around to go downstairs to ask for help my vision and the room went back to normal. I now wish I did not get so worried because by doing so I might have stopped the experience. Since then I have tried many times to bring back those moments as I really would like to know what all of that was, but with no success. I have read many STE but I have not found anything similar to what I have experienced. I know that whatever it was it was real and I have not imagined it. If anybody has any idea of the significance of my experience I would be extremely grateful if they could get in contact with me to help me understand what happened that day. Thank you.

1717,ME ,1462,23,,M,"Floating in an erect and body as light air: As I was walking, I became aware of a strangely subtle force coming over me. I felt a kind of vibration starting to run up through my body. It was soft at first, then became more pronounced as time went on. I felt the top of my head being pulled straight up while at the same time, my hips were being pulled downward into the earth. It felt as though I was being supported by a bolt of energy that literally ran through my body. The energy expanded from above me and from down below at the same time. My posture became very straight and It felt as though I was floating and weightless within it. I was surprised at how effortless it was to be so light and erect. It reminded me of the description a Tai Chi teacher once gave me of how to stand correctly, as if heaven were pulling me upwards by the top of my head and earth pulling me downwards from somewhere near the prostrate.  Effortless Breathing  Breathing became deep, light and effortless. I found myself witnessing each breath without the experience of guilt or anxiety resisting each in or exhale. All the usual tension in my solar plexus, tightness in my diagram and tension in my lungs had vanished. Breathing became a brand new experience for me, where I was able to take very satisfying and refreshing breaths.I marveled at what was happening to me, It felt wonderful to feel so free and light on the earth in my body. After time it occurred to me that this experience surely couldnt last very long because it felt so wonderful. I waited a while to see if it would leave. I waited for the familiar tension, anxiety, the heaviness of the body and breath to return. After a very short time, I let go and allowed the wonderful experience to guide me. Where did the mind go? As I surrendered more to the experience I became aware that thoughts werent being created on the fly, I had them, but I was creating them when needed and by choice, by powerful choice, they werent free floating and coming out of no where and they certainly werent attacking me. It was like the experiences of floating lightly within my body that had a very erect posture or breathing unburdened by guilt, anxiety, depression, anger, self hatred, self judgement. Now I was experiencing emptiness where 100s of thoughts per seconds should have been. The triad of experiences was connected together and created a sense of great joy, understanding and freedom. Freeing because I had always known myself to be what my thoughts told me I was, and here, those thoughts not existing at all, it was a beautiful realization that I still lived on without them. With the mind being opaque, its opinions laid to rest, the veil of ignorance lifted and laid bare, the truth stood squarely in my face, It was awe inspiring it was beautiful, it was more than joyful. There was no doubt about It. It became clear to me that the mind was not all powerful, all knowing or omnipotent, but rather a mirage that wasnt there when looked at from the side of truth. The truth not only showed what the I was part of, bliss, freedom, love, oneness with all, but at the same time, what I have never been; body, guilty and deserving of punishment, hatred, shame, terror and death. The mind was impotent and could not stand its ground when directly facing the truth. Experiencing truth was the most joyous, romantic and blissful experience. I was free from the slavery of illusion, free to experience the reality of my being, free to love and be loved solely because I was.  How could my past vanish without sins being accounted for? I pondered the implications of how such a ferociously powerful mind grasping into every part of my being every second of my life could have been tossed aside into non existence so matter of faculty. All that I had known myself to be was born out of the abuse and abandonment by my parents. Guilt, anxiety, self hatred, fear\xe2\x80\xa6 they had been my family in the absence of a family, all gone in a flash. How could it be that all sins were forgiven just like that as if thered never been a past me? What did this mean about my reality? Then it occurred to me, for the first time in my life, I was awake. I had never experienced being awake like this. By realizing that I was awake, I could see how I had been dreaming. Truth was showing me that the mind had been lulling me into an non ending dream state with all of its endless thoughts. I had simply awoken from a dream of guilt and shame, terror and death and saw that I had been dreaming. Being able to tell the difference between a dream and being awake is the truth, it is everything, all doubt vanishes. It is easy to tell one has been dreaming when one is awake and therefor no the difference between dreaming and experiencing the truth.

1724,DEE,1300,23,,M,"My fathers office was divided into two spaces--a 2nd floor front office where he worked (with large windows overlooking the street below and surrounded by several multi-story apartment buildings), and the back office--a large bright kitchen/lounge area (illuminated by skylights)--connected to the front via a private 20 foot corridor. As soon as I arrived and handed my father the story, I felt that same strange feeling in my heart like I had felt a year earlier--the feeling that compelled me to pray. Not wishing a repeat of what happened a year earlier (see my other DEE entry)--I excused myself, telling my father I would wait in the back lounge while he read. My father wasnt spiritual or religious, and I was embarrassed that I suddenly felt a strange urge to pray. I entered the back lounge, and shut the door. I then got down on my knees and bowed y head to the floor for the first time in my life. And I suddenly started to weep. Like, uncontrollably sob. And words came out of my mouth that werent words from conscious intention. I was baffled to hear myself speaking the words. Why are we so bad? Why are we so bad? You have to understand,I didnt have a bad bone in my body. I was kind, and sensitive, and yet, these words were flowing from my mouth. And I felt such deep deep shame. Moments later, however, I felt a hand press down on the small of my back. I tried to left my head up to see who was there, but like my hands suck together in the previous DEE, this time my whole body was stuck to the floor. Quite literally, I was pinned there and couldnt move. Before I had a chance to be afraid, however, I suddenly felt two firm hands grasp my head, lift it off the floor, and turn it to the right. And there, beside me, was a fully manifested Celestial Being, kneeling on the floor beside me and looking compassionately into my eyes. As I previously wrote, my family wasnt religious, and I had no knowledge of religion at all. However, I immediately knew this Celestial Being was Jesus like I had known him my whole life. He was bearded, and wearing simple robes. (I no longer remember the color of the robes or the color of his eyes--I was too astonished that he was there in the room with me.) His eyes were mesmerizing--I was literally transfixed by his gaze. Where I had been sobbing moments earlier, and feeling deep shame, I suddenly felt the most incredible all-encompassing feeling of unconditional love. I wasnt scared. I was in bliss. And there wasnt anything I needed to ask. I felt as if I knew everything, as if I was everything, as if I was the Love itself. And a message was transmitted to me with this Love. You are loved. You are forgiven. You are respected. You are accepted. You are special and you are important. You are cared for, and everything is perfect. All of this transpired in a matter of seconds, and then Jesus bowed his head to the floor and prayed. And the hands that had moved my head to see Jesus, turned my head back to the floor, and continued to hold me there. The next thing I remember, my father opened the door and asked me if I was okay. No, I said. Im pinned to the floor. Please call Mom. While my father went back to the front office (there was no phone in the lounge), my experience suddenly changed dramatically. I was suddenly hearing sounds that were loud and clear and very real, but very distressing. The sounds were of emergency sirens, gunfire, and women shrieking in terror. At the same time, in my minds eye, I could see the major urban intersection near my fathers office with windows all blown out, burned out shells of cars in the street, and snipers scurrying in the shadows. I thought I was being shown a vision of the end of the world, but when I asked if that is what this was, there were no answers. Moments later, my father returned, and I found that I was able to get up off the floor. My mother was on the phone and wanted to speak with me, so I headed to the front office. However, as soon as I walked into the office and saw the large picture windows, I was immediately stricken with the most intense paranoia. I collapsed to the floor, certain that I was going to get shot by a sniper (probably connected to the frightening vision I had moments earlier). Long story not as long, this paranoia lasted another half hour or so during which time my father managed to get me into his car and drive me to his house (my old family house where the previously reported DEE took place). Once I got home, and was under the care of my mother, the paranoia dissipated. However, it transformed into a mania that lasted for another 40 hours or so, during which time I believed I knew everything about everything, wrote many things about God and life, and couldnt sleep. Finally, after about 40 hours, I crashed and slept for 16 hours. When I woke up, I was back to my normal self agai",,Canadian,1 mill,agnostic,spiritual,Unaffilia,Unaffilia,,,dail,never,very strong,none,"50,000 99",some,Freelan,,single,marri,Yes,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

What is really interesting is that prior to this event, I was always terrified of my wife getting kidnapped and killed. Since this event, I have no fear because I know it is left over from India. Anyway, the English soldiers came back the next day and burned our village. I was raped and my nipples cut off. I remember being held down in one of the buildings, like a stable, as others looked on. Interestingly, I have a birthmark under one of my nipples, and I have always hated having them touched. I was then killed...

1741,ADC,1377,51,,M,This is the actual text message I sent Subject: Message from Mum Hi Lone Im just awake and have just finished relaying to Sue a dream I have just finished having about an hour ago. This was unlike ANYTHING I have ever experienced in my life and I guess u may believe what Im about to say or not then thats fine. It was a message from Mum for me and us all. Ill try to describe it but the detail was as good if not better than real life. Ok this is what I was shown and told by Mum mainly. Others I saw were Dad and you. Everyone is happy and come and go busy doing exactly what they want in real life just the same. Same voices same mannerisms and smiling. As you think of some one some place or some thing it materialises and its there for you to touch use and even the smells are the same. The detail blew me away as Mum walked me from room to room by my arm and showed me that her home is still alive and well and shes home living there with all her gear pictures everything. I saw the laundry all full. I gave Mum a big kiss and she was happy to see me and have me visit. Each room was perfect right down to the wood grain on the cupboard doors and wardrobes. It was clearer than I can even remember now. I could touch and feel everything. I said can I look in the huts and I did opening the door and checking both out. The smell was the same lol. They were full of junk And I said to Mum how come and she said we keep all the extra gear in there because us kids arnt there. When I was inside the house if I concentrated real hard I could almost see the burnt walls and floors like a shadow or silhouette but Mum said to me firmly with a serious look on her face that she is NOT going to allow me to see that and it vanished. She said that our home exists in two different places at once. Its like one place is on 92fm and her place is 102fm. They share the same place or space but out of tune so u dont see the other. Anyway we had visitors come and go with cups of tea. Dad arrived in from up the farm smiling and whistling. You arrived for a visit and chat also happy and smiling. Everything coming and going as I thought of them. When I was in Mums old bedroom with the built in mirror I tried to look at myself but when I did I was like a ghost. Very faint and just a shape. And yet I could see the bloody grain in the varnished doors right beside. We went to the A&amp;P show and there were not many people there but it was on. What happens is only the people you knew and think about come through. This explains how in the spirit world its not jammed packed with every person who has passed on just your loved ones and friends coming and going like real life. Ok back home again and Muns really young and beautiful probably in her twenties. See they can appear as any age they want. I knew it was mum. I swung her around then she fell over a chair laughing. I had tea with Mum and now the afternoon was getting darker it was time for me to go. I have her a big hug and began to cry with joy. I knew I was experiencing a dream but it was much too real for just a memory and I could ask questions. I thought I would wake Sue with my crying but I went back to Mum. She smiled and said she is happy and well and not to fear. I asked her if I could come and visit her again but she got serious again and said no but she will think about it. I said how about once a week and I begged her but she smiled and said maybe. Oh well I thought. I walked out the gate and some guys standing on the driveway who looked like Eddie yates. He was wearing a parka and there was a farm implement behind him. I said to him who are you ? and he told me his name. Random spirits appear too and he was out the gate and seemed to be waiting for Dad to come out to see him. I hopped into my car yes u can drive in the afterlife but its cool . You dont have miles of boring nothingness. Next second Im on my way home to Hokitika and I stop in a town. I got out at a park and some guys sitting there in his car with his mouth wide open looking at me. I said what are u looking at ? He says you are bloody flying and floating up in the air. I said so ... You can too come on up so he hops out and flies up to me. He was hopeless and tumbled over. I laughed. Then I awoke in bed at home with tears running down my cheeks and so bloody happy I had to wake Sue and relay this story. It was not a dream but was a real experience. It was like a near death experience without the death. I could see anything I wanted and ask questions at will. I feel a lot more content about home and Mum and I have been shown a glimpse of heaven. It was SOOO nice I can see why Mum is restricting my return. If u stay and dont go back you die and its not my time. But we are allowed to visit but only when our loved ones allow us.

1743,DEE,1319,51,,F,"I awoke at 2:00 a.m. and noticed a dim light that appeared to be emanating from the wall in the hallway. I thought that was odd, as all the lights in our apartment were turned off and my husband was asleep in the living room. I sat up in bed to get a closer look when I saw two images very clearly displayed on the hallway wall, which appeared in the center of that dim light. They were two shadows, one in the shape of a butterfly and one in the shape of a dove. They were quite detailed. The butterfly, for example, had the veins in its wings prominently outlined as if it were made of stained glass- but it was a shadow, in black and white. The dove also appeared to resemble an image you might see on stained glass, only black and white. I sat up further and spoke out loud to myself: I am awake. This is real. What I am seeing is real... Then, the butterflys wings began to move and it flew up the wall and to the ceiling, where it disappeared. Next, the doves wings began to flutter, and it also moved up toward the ceiling and disappeared. I had the intense impression that this was a sign that I had moved in a positive spiritual direction that day, by having that talk earlier with my husband in which I opened up about myself. I felt very, very happy. Not ecstatic, just happy. I remember smiling intensely before going back to sleep.

My partner at the time was engaged in guided meditation and spiritual connection and growth. She convinced me to look to meditation and I discovered that I could use the pendulum quite successfully. I began to work very hard at the spiritual connection that I was forming. After a period of time i was able to hear messages and feel spiritual presence.I was shown the different spheres and told of the existence of other worlds and other dimensions. I had come to a point in my life where change was necessary. God had played a major part in my life until age 13....I felt divorced from him at age 49 and quite spiritually, emotionally and physically lost. In these early days of my transformation i was meditating and the room was flooded with a beautiful golden light. I felt myself being lifted from the chair....tears streamed down my face and the overwhelming message was to love God.

1751,ADC,1173,34,,F,"Sunday morning at a local antique car show with my family I was overcome by a message in my head from a grandmotherly voice. You can eat less, you will still be fed. You dont have to fear not being fed, it is a different time now. I knew pretty quickly that the message was for the intuitive. However, I did not want to pass on the message. As a psychiatrist I was keenly aware that such a message could be exceedingly destructive to a person with a history of an eating disorder. I resisted the STE...this only made the message louder and more difficult to ignore. It repeated not only in my head but in my body, insistent. I felt myself becoming rapidly ill. My body ached as though I had the flu. Within 30 minutes I had to leave my family at the antique care show and go home. At home I tried vainly to ignore the pounding message and sleep to no avail. Finally in desperation I said aloud okay, already, Ill tell her. I sent the intuitive an email explaining the situation and while I had extreme doubts about the social moire and the professional impropriety of my action, as soon as I sent the email I was flooded with relief. The flu-like symptoms and the message vanished. I crawled to bed and slept deeply for several hours until my family returned (as I have never done before.) It was several days before the intuitive finally contacted me and told me that she had prayed to her grandmother the friday before I met her asking desperately for help with her weight gain. The intuitive was perplexed that she normally receives insights for her clients, yet here was a straight-laced ivy league educated physician being contacted by her grandmother with literally the answer to her prayers. When I saw the same intuitive two years later for a brief ten minutes, she revealed that the message had quite literally changed her life. Specifically she had been able to return to her typical body weight easily and without dieting and maintained it for the intervening time. Secondly she had secured a new job and a book deal where my message to her was the climax of her autobiographical book!

1752,SDE,1277,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

Its hard to explain but at the moment that the hand touched me and I was told that everything would be fine, I knew that everything really was going to be fine and my mind was INSTANTLY put at peace (and my body felt warm and safe).

I understood that each light represented one person and the color denoted their state of happiness or unhappiness.

I cried and trembled. Suddenly something other-wordly occurred. I saw Cloy at the end of the hallway. She came towards me into my room. I recognized her because of her outer form. I say outer form because she was translucent, yet color filled, if that makes any sense. I could see through her, yet I could recognize completely that it was her. As she came towards me I said in exclamation, Cloy!\xe2\x80\x9d  It is difficult to describe what happened after that because words cannot describe what occurred next. There simply are no words on this planet for it. All that I can say is that Cloy somehow filled me with what she feels wherever she now is. Suddenly I felt as if someone had placed a needle about two to three inches long in each and every pore over my entire body, starting at the top of my head and ending with the bottom of my toes. The needles had something in them that was the essence of pure unadulterated ecstasy. It was a joy that I have never felt in this earthly existence, and I am certain that it does not exist at the earthly level of vibrational being. The needles tingled full of warm bubbly unconditional love. It was Christmas and Valentines and Halloween all in one. It was chocolate kisses and truffles and the sweet nectar of watercress fresh out of the mountain spring. It was children\xe2\x80\x99s laughter and hugs and unity squared. I was in a state of complete euphoria and exultation that I have never before or since experienced. I was involuntarily smiling from ear to ear. I could feel myself smiling, but it was not me doing it. Seconds before I had been in utter agony. Now, I was so overcome with happiness, that the smile on my face felt permanent. I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not smiling I am being smiled!\xe2\x80\x9d  I lay in the midst of this pleasure and rapture as the needles continued to tingle and pour warm, pure, syrupy, liquid affection into my veins. The veins carried it swiftly to my major organs and I breathed tender compassion. My blood became a river of sweet adulation. I then realized that if there were a drug that could reproduce that feeling \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d be on it twenty-four-seven. As a social worker dealing with methamphetamine users, I had wondered why in the world these people would take drugs and lose everything for it. Instantaneously I knew the answer. I mean, if it feels anything like what I felt that night, I can understand why someone would sell their soul for it. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this feeling was ethereal from another realm. I could only guess that Cloy was aware of my secret agony and she was giving me the ecstatic feeling that is constantly present wherever she is to assuage my pain. The message of the feeling was one of (and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to say this in words because it was conveyed to me beyond words \xe2\x80\x93 it was communicated soul to soul, mind to mind \xe2\x80\x93 words just cheapen it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how else to describe it except with words) \xe2\x80\x9cJane, you are loved unconditionally and you are OK just the way you are. The apostles aren\xe2\x80\x99t right. The church isn\xe2\x80\x99t right. There is no right. There is no duality. Love, love, love. You are love and you are loved. There is only love.\xe2\x80\x9d   I closed my eyes and luxuriated in the heavenly tingling. Eventually it subsided. The needles slowly pulled out of my body, starting at the top of my head and finally leaving altogether through the ends of my toes. I am thankful to Cloy for showing me such support and joy.

All of a sudden I felt myself come out of my body and in a flash, my spirit, or whatever you want to call it, was out of my body, across the room, in front of the television. I saw the television and then I was just there, right in front of it. It was still on but I cant recall what was showing at the time this happened, I just know it was on and I could see it. I remember feeling this amazing sense of freedom and that I could go anywhere I wanted, as quickly as I wanted. I looked at the hotel room door and thought to myself, I want to go out there, see how far I can go like this. It was a very very pleasant and unbelievably exciting feeling, but I was also scared.  In that instant while I was looking at the door thinking about going further, reveling in this sense of freedom, speed and excitement, I suddenly I heard a voice (it wasnt a voice like we speak in the literal world, it was a voice that I could identify as male, I think, but instead of speaking out loud, it was like a knowledge in my head. Its hard to convey this correctly) saying If you want this to stop, you have to wake up now. I heard it and was still looking at the door. The voice/knowledge again said Sally, if you want this to stop you have to wake up NOW! with heavy heavy emphasis on the word NOW.

1780,OBE,1392,22,,M,"This story is an account of an amazing venture into the future that came about by what I, years later, came to know as a Near Death Experience. Although I wasnt physically near death at the time, I experienced all the earmarks of a classic Near Death Experience, including leaving my physical body and traveling at tremendous speeds through a variety of mystical dimensions.   A Window in Time By Joe   The cold March rain dripped steadily off the back porch awning as I ran water for my morning coffee. Through the kitchen window I could see streaks of snow across the muddy back yard. Where the yard ended and the dark gray bark of maple trees along the hillside took over, the snow still covered all the land. The phone rang. Setting down the coffee pot, I reached for the phone. Hello. I said. You wanna meet for lunch? Jim asked without even bothering to say hello. Sure, I replied. Anything to get me out and away from the boredom. We exchanged a few more words and hung up. I put the coffee pot on the stove, grabbed a quick shower, put on a sweatshirt, poured myself a cup of coffee, and sat down to read a couple chapters from an Eric Von Daniken book I had just picked up the day before. A couple hours later, I put on a rainproof windbreaker and headed for town. When I arrived at Charlies Lounge, Jim was already there. Whats the special?, I asked the bartender.  Burger and fries, he said. Good enough for me, I replied. Put some cheese on it too. Jim looked over and smiled. You wanna beer? Ah, its a little early for that I said. Come on, one with lunch wont hurt you. he said. Get him a draught, he said to the bartender. Jim was a road construction worker who hadnt been working for the past couple weeks due to the incessant rain. Id known him since we were kids. His boredom wasnt as intense as mine, but the cold, dreary rain was getting a lot of people down in this tiny Pennsylvania railroad town. It was a tough little town along the edge of the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania. The heart of Appalachia was just a few minutes away. The Vietnam War was just winding down and Watergate was front page news every day. Life, like the weather, was bleak. A month earlier I had finished a two year stint as a Military Policeman in Germany.  I was accustomed to the excitement of constant stimulation. As a policeman I had weathered the drama and tragedy of the Munich Olympics, witnessed first hand the violence of the militant Baader-Meinhof Gang, and while wearing the white hat of law enforcement, had been front and center in the unpredictable and dangerous world of heroin addiction. Okay, Ill sip on a beer, I said to the bartender. Jim smiled. When I looked in his direction I could see a couple guys playing a game of pool. Immediately my radar went off. Two brothers were playing a game of eightball. One of the brothers was a year older than me, and had been a superb football player. The other brother was a year younger than me and had always been a bit of a troublemaker. And, he was drunk! It just past noon and he was drunker than a skunk. Several years earlier, I had been in an all out fight with the younger one. I had knocked him down and was on top of him, pounding the living daylights out of him when someone pulled me off.  Here he was again. Drunk, and this time with his older brother, who it appeared he was going to try and impress. He was staring at me. His face was getting red. I could feel my adrenalin surging. Every drop of testosterone in my body was lit up. The two years in the military had added 30 pounds of muscle to my body. I had been trained in judo and self defense techniques. I was capable of putting anyone into submission in seconds. I was ready! To avoid initiating any confrontation and to maintain my focus, I chose to gaze at the cue ball(the all white pool ball) as it bounded around the pool table. A moment went by, then two. I kept my focus on the cue ball. I began developing a slightly different mind set. I clearly remembering saying to myself, I choose to not allow my emotions to dictate my actions. I choose to just stay focused on the neutral cue ball. Then BOOM, it happened. Suddenly, without warning, my entire state of consciousness shot directly out of the top of my head. Everything I knew to be me was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and accelerating by the second. At first I seemed to have shot through a tunnel like zone, then into a brightly lit world. I went past cities, land masses, continents, entire worlds. and universes. I clearly remember seeing a great River.

We had met this group of people the year before, so they were new to us. It was a sunny day and I was talking to a very suntanned man everyone called Mike the Painter, to distinguish him, I suppose, from all the other Mikes. While I was talking to Mike, his whole face suddenly turned a deathly gray color. It happened in a snap, as if you turned on a light and boom! I guess it was shocking to see because my brain took a couple of seconds before I realized that his face had changed to gray. His face was gray for several seconds and then it snapped back to his normal tan color. I stood there staring at him. I dont remember what he was saying. I do not drink or do drugs. After that happened and in the next day or two, I remember thinking about Mikes face and wondering if it did indeed turn gray. I couldnt believe I saw his whole face a gray color. I tried to disbelieve this experience had happened to me. I tried to deny that his face had turned gray. But every time I tried to deny it, I kept affirming that I did indeed see that Mikes face instantly turned gray, stayed gray for several seconds, then instantly turned back to tan. Since Im a visual person and a visual artist, I couldnt deny that I saw his face was gray because my mind sort of takes a picture of it and, also, I was able to call it up in my memory and I would see it again, so I couldnt really deny the gray color. I ended up believing that this happened, even if I didnt understand why it happened or why I saw it. A day or two later I understood what I saw and why I saw it. Mike was a heavy smoker. He was usually smoking a cigarette whenever I saw him. I believed that God wanted me to warn Mike to stop smoking or hell pass at a young age. I waited a whole year before I got up the courage to tell Mike. I didnt want this new group of friends to think I was a religious zealot or crazy. So that summer I went up to Mike and told him what I saw and that I was meant to pass this warning to him. I apologized if he thought I was a zealot but Mike stopped me and said he was Catholic and believed that people see signs from God. He said he wasnt going to stop smoking and thanked me for telling him. I saw Mike every summer for a few years after that time and noticed that he was still smoking.

(I was somewhere between 3-5 years old) My father had gone to visit a neighbor two doors down (old Mr Safran) I was a timid child and for some reason I was utterly scared of this neighbor, even though there was no reason to be. He actually was a kindly old gentleman who even remembered the neighborhood children in his will but for whatever reason I was very frightened of him.

1798,ME ,1489,56,,M," By about nine p.m. I noticed that I was hearing songs in a way I never had before. I seemed to be entering more deeply than usual into the mind of the writer and understanding what was being emotionally conveyed. So I kept listening. I felt the sorrows and joys of others as they spoke to me in song. I felt the tragic beauty in the passions, lost hopes and brevity of life as experienced by other people. There was a collision of sadness and beauty, a kind of majestic sorrow. I wondered if it was due to being fifty six years of age and being able to relate to many situations in life. Shivers repeatedly rose in waves up my spine from its base. I could not recall ever enjoying music to such an extent. I identified so closely with the singers, I became them. I could get up and go to the bathroom or get a drink of chilled water from the kitchen without losing the spinal effect. I then returned to the headphones and Yahoo Radio on the computer. The shivers of pleasure continued to rise in waves up my spine and began to intensify and surge down my legs and up my arms. The base of my head, at the rear, where the spine joins the skull was hit by waves of exquisite sensation with each new song. It felt like a hand was gripping the upper back of my neck where it meets the skull, and channelling in high voltage pleasure direct to my brain. After each wave of energy up my spine, this sensation did not totally subside, but seemed to remain as a scintillation of increased magnitude higher than the level before it. I became concerned as the euphoric physical effects intensified and extended in duration. I checked my pulse by the clock to see if I had an elevated heart rate associated with panic attacks. My pulse was normal and steady and my body felt very, very relaxed. I had the sensation of settling or falling back, deeper within my body, as the experience continued. My mind was paradoxically calm, intensely present, sharply aware and my cognition totally functioning and nimble. The waves of sensation up my spine became a volcanic rush that entered my head. I was thinking \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Oh, Oh! Awesome! Go with it!\xe2\x80\x9d Rivers of energy flowed outwards along my limbs. By now it was after midnight. My body felt almost weightless. I felt immense power flowing through my body. At one point I looked at my hands and they felt so full of the sensation of energy and so insubstantial that I wondered if they might pass through the wall if I tried. I touched the wall out of curiosity and my hand was certainly still solid as it touched the wall! It was just that I could not feel my hand. It went on and on, hour after hour as powerful waves of surging energy, ever intensifying. I was totally immersed in intense ecstasy. Suddenly, there was another huge rush of energy upwards. There was complete darkness. I found my locus of consciousness now resting in the centre of my head as a tiny pin point. The room I was sitting in had totally disappeared from sight. It was dark and comforting in the centre of my brain. Then, there was a final atomic eruption I could feel rising beneath this tiny \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d, my centre of total awareness, and it burst forth from the top of my head carrying that tiny point in a massive torrent of energy that felt like a clear, cool viscous liquid, and my awareness emerged into a infinite yet intimate space which was like an endless ocean where I felt connected to all things in the cosmos. I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! I must have died! Oh well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d I had no fear. I was merely a point of consciousness with no body at all. I was overcome with immense gratitude for the privilege of having been alive, and for my life with its joys as well as its sorrows and the total improbability of just being. I thanked God.  Following on was an instantaneous, total life review. It was like viewing a three hundred and sixty degree panoramic picture screen with all of my life events played out simultaneously. Many of the things I had thought very significant in my life were not at all important. My preconceptions of right and wrong melted away. I did not feel judged in any way, I felt completely accepted. Everything was meaningful in my life and nothing I had experienced was wasted. The only things that now mattered in my past life were the times I had shown loving compassion to other people and living things. Then I felt enormous, limitless, feelings of joy, love, compassion and empathy for humankind and all living things. I felt intimate kinship with all humanity. I somehow was The Divine Mother with a heart for all my suffering beings and wanted to encompass them in arms of love and mercy and tell them everything was all right and always had been. Everything was perfect and always had been and always would be.

I needed to speak of bring love and not focus on hate or enemies. The angel told me it knew I felt very alone but to remember that I was not and that I should keep putting out the message of love.

1823,OBE,1341,66,,F,"I decided to take a Past-Life Workshop in the small, homey office of a hypnotist in Katonah, New York last year. Besides the hypnotist, another woman and myself were present. Before the session started, the pleasant hypnotist explained that she was going to hypnotize us. (I tried hypnosis one other time in my life but I couldnt be hypnotized. I thought, however, that I would try it again.) She said we would be going down a long flight of stairs. As we went down, we would be getting more and more tired. When we reached the bottom of the stairs, we would be hypnotized. Then she would direct us to go into a room where we would see who we were and where we were in our past life. It all sounded pretty okay, nothing scary. So, sitting in comfortable chairs, we closed our eyes and the leader directed us down a long flight of stairs. I remember the stairway was dark, but not frightening, and I was getting more and more tired. At the bottom of the stairs, she told us to open the door in front of us and go into the room but I saw a window opened and I flew out instead. I flew out into the dark universe. I wasnt in a spacecraft, it was just me flying. I remember just flying around in the darkness but not feeling afraid. I have a sensation that I was a young woman then, not my senior age at the time of this STE. I never actually heard anything. My experience was silent. I dont remember feeling cold or hot, but just right. I was wearing an ordinary set of clothes--pants and a top. I remember loving the experience of flying. I felt peaceful, serene and happy. I was flying alone, although I have a sense that my husband, Hank, was there from time to time. I remember seeing faraway stars and planets but I didnt land on anything. I was in heaven, in more ways than one. At some point I became aware that I was struggling to do something--waking up. I didnt want to leave the universe, I was enjoying flying so much, but I was awakening to my present human reality in the hypnotists office. When I awoke, the other woman was already awake. The hypnotist asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said I was having a hard time waking up. She thought I fell asleep but I told her I wasnt sleeping. The other woman talked about her experience and then I talked about my flying experience. The woman and hypnotist didnt say anything while I was describing my OBE. The session ended pretty much there. I remember feeling strange about being in this strange world on Earth. I wasnt sure I was okay enough to go out into the street and drive my car home, but I was.

I had only been married about 6 months, and I was beginning to realize that perhaps I had made a mistake marrying this man...that he wasnt all that in love with me. A few days earlier, I had said a prayer and asked if this was all there was to marriage and asked for help from God even though I want sure if there really was a God.  A few days later, I was asleep next to my husband. And I felt like I was having a dream with this bright light appearing. It was the brightest light I had ever seen...almost a piercing blue white light. I opened my eyes and realized this was not a dream at all! I looked into my closest where the doors were open and out of the left back side of the closest, the light radiated from. I wasnt scared...actually it was quite comforting. I quickly woke my husband up. He couldnt believe what he was seeing either. I kept saying, what is it? Is this real or are we imaging it. We both just sat there for about a minute staring at the light. Again, it was the brightest light I had ever seen but, the light didnt radiate throughout the room but stayed concentrated in the closest. After it disappeared, I just continued to sit up in bed trying to figure out what had just happened. Then, out of the blue, I began speaking in a language that I had never heard. My husband heard me, and thought I was going crazy. I had no idea what was happening. It wasnt scary....just really weird. This continued non stop for about 3 hours until I was completely exhausted and went to sleep at about 6am that am. When I woke up, I was completely perplexed as to what just happened to me. I decided I needed to go talk to someone about this so I went and visited with my priest at the Episcopal church at the time. He tried to explain it but, I was still perplexed as I had never heard of speaking I tongues, nor had I asked to have that given to me.

Trapped inside my body and unable to move or speak, there werent many options. I thought that if I could just hold onto a thought with my mind, I would not die. So, I thought of a tree. I pictured a tree in my mind, imagined how it felt to be next to a tree, and kept repeating the word tree over and over.  I began to feel like I was moving through a dark tunnel. I felt afraid...and clung to my inner tree life rope as I moved along the dark passageway.  I moved through a darkness...murkiness... that included spirit like beings roaming around making some sounds... I did not recognize any of them...they were misty, grey entities floating around. I felt fear. I realized I could no longer see the word for tree in my mind...but I could still see the tree, and feel its presence.  I continued to move through the darkness and the spirits were gone. The tunnel was lighter. I had an instant awareness of my whole life...like a 360 degree view of everything about my life. It was extremely expansive knowing and deep knowledge. I no longer felt afraid. And I could no longer see the tree in my mind, but I could feel its presence. I was aware that there was a place I had traveled from...and I had family there... but I was not worried because I also knew that in the scheme of all I suddenly knew...all I was remembering had been just a flicker of time...my whole life had happened in less than a snap of my finger.  The light in the tunnel grew brighter and closer. I was travelling fast. Suddenly I burst though into a sea of Light...only Light.... I no longer felt the presence of the tree, because I realized I am the tree! I am everything! This was not a thought...but a knowing. An all expansive knowing.  The feeling was completely ecstatic...like an orgasm without a body. No body to limit the deep and ongoing BLISS. There were no words... just knowing. The knowing was The only thing that matters is Love... all Love It was timeless and so pure. The direct experience of Divine Love Then I became aware of something forming... like a vibration. I realized it was a thought coming into form... and the thought was: What about my son? (I had a 5 month old son at home) As soon as the vibration became a thought, I immediately began travelling back through the tunnel... fast!  I woke up in the recovery room.

1831,OBE,1371,26,,M,"What I observed, felt and saw were the most real things I ever experienced. As I slept, I didnt just float away I shot off like a rocket. I was going warp speed with a destination pre-programmed. I didnt know consciously where I was headed, I just knew I was going. It was very much the sensation of flying through space. It was dark like space, but I dont remember darkness. I do recall zooming past worlds, orbs really, not planets in the physical sense, but worlds nonetheless, near and far. I traveled at this warp speed what I could sense was a vast distance, multitudes beyond what we even have measurements for. When I came out of my travels, I found myself in the presence of these two men as described above.  And HERE is the most remarkable, profound, and intense part of this experience: Despite their important work of apparently saving a large population, when I arrived there, they both turned their full attention to me. Here, words truly lose their meaning. I have great reverence for these two men and the work they were seemingly doing, yet despite this they afforded me their full attention and admiration and love. They were happy to see ME! But it was so much more than that. I felt all of the infinite and unconditional love of the universe, the acceptance, everything Dr. Eben discussed in his book, if I may use that cop-out in lieu of attempting to describe the indescribable.  At the time, I had been dealing with being disrespected as a new EMT in a culture that big on attitude and tradition and small on respect. I learned one of the most important lessons of my life in that moment: That every being on earth is greeted with %1,000 full attention, love, admiration, and acceptance by God, with no regard to anything else thats going on. I cant fathom how its possible to everywhere and doing everything at once, despite the fact that I experienced beings capable of that while making me the center and sole focus of all that infinite love.  I clumsily and, I feel, stupidly introduced myself as Josh, from Oregon, as though that would have made sense. It did, apparently. As we all floated above this world with refugees down below, information was exchanged. There was a discussion. I do not recall nor did I upon waking- that discussion that was shared between the three of us. I was there to experience what I had upon my arrival. My mother, whom I was best friends with, died in 2002. My family was shattered, but I was the apple of my mothers eye. Her death is something that I still havent dealt with fully. I sense that this was at the heart of that exchange, however it was with some other part of me that I dont have access to right now.  When this conversation concluded, whatever it was, I remember making the journey back to my body. It was the exact same immeasurable distance, yet the time it took was very... well, there was no quick or slow about it. It just was. When I arrived back to my body, I snapped awake.  I immediately called my father who had been close friends with Pir Vilayat. My dad was very supportive and receptive, even happy that I had such a special dream.

1834,DEE,1299,22,,M,"I entered my bedroom, sat down on a cushioned window seat, and the sobbing continued. Moments later, I felt a tingling in my arms, kind of like they had fallen asleep, though I wasnt sitting in a way that impaired blood flow. Moments later, my arms rose from my sides and my hands literally came together in prayer in front of my chest. I watched in complete wonderment as this occurred. And I suddenly felt in my heart a very clear instruction that I needed to get on my knees and pray. But I was refused. I didnt understand why prayer was necessary. In fact, it seemed like an act of subservience that made me uneasy. Meanwhile, my arms and hands were literally vibrating, and my hands were stuck together that literally, I was unable to pull them apart. Why is this happening to me, I wondered. And I suddenly understood that I was dying. No sooner did that thought cross my mind, my hands fell back to my sides--thus making a connection in my mind between the thought I was dying and the release of my hands from the unseen force, and the immediate cessation of the tingling sensations. Given how strange this all was, it seemed perfectly logical to me that I was indeed dying. My mother was spiritual, so I thought I better go downstairs and tell her. In the living room, I sat beside my mother and told her what had just happened. She told me to go ahead and pray. I told her I couldnt, and that I was dying. She was very spiritual. When she heard this, she thought perhaps a part of me was dying, to make room for something else... but I wasnt physically dying. I told her she was wrong. She checked my temperature. I had a fever of 103. She went to get some aspirin, and told me to to relax. After I took the aspirin, I lay down on the living room couch, and thats when a spiritual being showed up. I heard him as clear as day, talking in my head, just as if he was in the room with me. The first thing he said to me was, Ok, lets go! When he said that, I could feel a pulling sensation all of a sudden on the region of my solar plexus. If the soul was real, it felt like he was reaching in and pulling my soul out of my body. It was a very uncomfortable and unusual feeling, and I reacted to it by kicking my feet on the couch. When I did this, the pulling, or suction-y feeling stopped. Long story short, this fight to stay went on for more than an hour. I remained lucid throughout the whole experience, conversing with my family while also telepathically conversing with this Being. The longer I resisted, the more this Being resorted to threatening me. I didnt care--no matter what the threats (Stay and youll be crazy, no one will ever understand you, your family wont remember a thing--their memories will be wiped) I refused to go wherever it was this Being was intent on taking me. Finally, fed up with my refusal, the Being told me he wasnt leaving empty handed. If I didnt come then and there, he would cause my father to have a massive heart attack, and he would take my father. My father and I had had a long and stormy relationship, however, I didnt have to think about that threat. I immediately relented and agreed to come. But I asked to say goodbye to my family first--which he permitted. I literally kissed and hugged everyone who was there and said goodbye. It was the saddest moment I have ever experienced. Then I told the Being I was finally ready, and I heard a voice (a different voice than the Being) tell me it wasnt my time. For a while I pleaded to go. I was ready. But it was no use. My fever broke, and I felt better than I had ever felt in my life-- and I appreciated my life like I had never appreciated it before.

The ventilation tube had been removed from his throat. He said to us that the worst part about the surgery was the ventilation tube and machine. He was so glad to have it out. I told me Mom about it and I had a strong feeling that my dad was going to be fine and come away okay from the surgery. When I told my Mom she wondered if the bright light could have meant my Dad had died. But I assured her that I knew he was going to be just fine. Well. That day when we visited my Dad in the hospital he was sitting up in bed there was light from the window on him illuminating him!

1840,DEE,1369,50,,F,"At the age of 50, I had an experience that transformed my life. I had been working with a tool in a secluded area of my home. I left the room for a few minutes, but when I returned, the tool had \xe2\x80\x9cvanished\xe2\x80\x9d and was never seen again. After exhausting every possible explanation for the disappearance, I felt my world falling apart. For the next few days, all I could do was to walk round and round the house in the hope that somehow the tool would mysteriously reappear. The experience was like being thrown into an alien universe, where all the laws of the only universe I had ever known had ceased to exist \xe2\x80\x93 it was like living in a world without gravity. When I eventually regained my composure, I began thinking of ways to solve the mystery. I had heard that the CIA uses psychics, so I made an appointment with one of these people in my area. Although he could not see what had happened to the tool, the psychic indicated that a being on the other side wanted to communicate with me. He described her as wearing a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s uniform and giving her first name as Edith. He could not understand her surname, but he thought it started with a C or a K. When I suggested \xe2\x80\x9cEdith Cavell\xe2\x80\x9d, he told me that was correct. (He had obviously never heard of the remarkable English nurse). Through the psychic, Edith accurately described a pendant I owned. She said I should hold it completely still and then ask her a question. If the answer was \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99, the pendant would move one way; if the answer was \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99, it would move another way. Being of a sceptical disposition, I did not believe that something I owned could ever move of its own accord. But on arriving home, I did what Edith had suggested and to my absolute astonishment, the pendant moved as she had indicated \xe2\x80\x93 either vertically or horizontally. After a new months of fruitful yes/no communication, I asked Edith a question one day, but instead of its usual movements, the pendant swung around in a circle. Eventually I discovered that a circle indicated the need to rephrase the question. Not long after that, Edith changed her mode of communication to one where she caused my hand to move in different directions. Then one day I asked a question, but there was no response. It turned out that Edith was handing me over to someone else. The only way I could ascertain the name of this being was to go through the alphabet. I found it almost impossible to believe that the name of the new guide I was being given was Aristotle. I was in such a state of anxiety that I contacted a renowned psychic without giving him any information about myself. At the consultation he told me he was being given a vision of philosophers in Ancient Greece. This gave me reassurance that I was not losing my mind. Aristotle told me that I should apply to do a PhD in philosophy, and that I should do a lot of background reading. To this day I have never been to a philosophy lecture \xe2\x80\x93 let alone studied in the field. When I eventually rang the Professor I had chosen, he \xe2\x80\x9cforgot\xe2\x80\x9d to ask me about the previous work I had done in philosophy.  After being accepted by the University, I began a difficult journey, but I had a wonderful supervisor who carried me through. At one point Aristotle said I would need to use a concept by the very early philosopher, Anaximander. Of course I had never heard of this thinker, but I used his concept to unite the various ideas I was presenting. Later on, Aristotle handed me over to the modern French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. By this time I had become used to the miraculous, which was just as well, because I found Jacques\xe2\x80\x99 writing difficult to grasp. In the end, thanks to all the help I was given from the other side, the two examiners I had described my dissertation as \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d. (It is titled \xe2\x80\x9cHeidegger and the mystery of being\xe2\x80\x9d and is on the web). Among other things it addresses the question of mysticism, and I am now interested in relating mystical experiences to the idea of the divine. From what I have read in Dr. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s book, and from my own experience, it seems difficult to conceive of God as an all-powerful being who sends people to hell if they don\xe2\x80\x99t repent. The evidence seems to be overwhelming that the whole of the universe is love.

1846,NDE,1078,25,,M,"After the mask was placed on my face, the doctor told me to count backwards from 10. I began to count. When I got to 1, I realized I couldnt breathe. I also could not speak or move...or open my eyes.  I began to panic inside. I thought..Im going to die!  Immediately I started to try and think of something that would help me stay alive. Trapped inside my body and unable to move or speak, there werent many options. I thought that if I could just hold onto a thought with my mind, I would not die. So, I thought of a tree. I pictured a tree in my mind, imagined how it felt to be next to a tree, and kept repeating the word tree over and over.  I began to feel like I was moving through a dark tunnel. I felt afraid...and clung to my inner tree life rope as I moved along the dark passageway.  I moved through a darkness...murkiness... that included spirit like beings roaming around making some sounds... I did not recognize any of them...they were misty, grey entities floating around. I felt fear. I realized I could no longer see the word for tree in my mind...but I could still see the tree, and feel its presence.  I continued to move through the darkness and the spirits were gone. The tunnel was lighter. I had an instant awareness of my whole life...like a 360 degree view of everything about my life. It was extremely expansive knowing and deep knowledge. I no longer felt afraid. And I could no longer see the tree in my mind, but I could feel its presence. I was aware that there was a place I had traveled from...and I had family there... but I was not worried because I also knew that in the scheme of all I suddenly knew...all I was remembering had been just a flicker of time...my whole life had happened in less than a snap of my finger.  The light in the tunnel grew brighter and closer. I was travelling fast. Suddenly I burst though into a sea of Light...only Light.... I no longer felt the presence of the tree, because I realized I am the tree! I am everything! This was not a thought...but a knowing. An all expansive knowing.  The feeling was completely ecstatic...like an orgasm without a body. No body to limit the deep and ongoing BLISS. There were no words... just knowing. The knowing was The only thing that matters is Love... all Love It was timeless and so pure. The direct experience of Divine Love Then I became aware of something forming... like a vibration. I realized it was a thought coming into form... and the thought was: What about my son? (I had a 5 month old son at home) As soon as the vibration became a thought, I immediately began travelling back through the tunnel... fast!  I woke up in the recovery room.

1851,ADC,1402,29,,F,"At the time, I described it as the most real and vivid dream I have ever had. In the dream, my deceased grandfather was communicating with me. He had passed away approximately ten years earlier and I had always said that I couldnt believe how much I missed him, even so many years after his death. This was my first loss and I took his death very hard because he had always been my father figure- my birth father had never been around (and died when I was 5), AND my relationship with my adoptive father was not close at all. Some specific details of the dream were not clear such as where we were or in what capacity my grandfather came to me, but I do remember that in the dream, I was very aware that it was impossible (in my understanding) for him to be there, communicating with me. My response in the dream was basically, How can this be, you are dead? I dont believe he said much to me, but I was so excited to have this time with him and I remember wanting to introduce him to my life since his death. I had no kids when he died and I wasnt married although I was dating my now husband. So, in the dream, I was feverishly trying to catch him up on all the events of my life...getting married, having two beautiful kids, going to university to become a teacher. I wanted him to be proud of me and I wanted so desperately to keep him around and involved in my life.  When I woke up, I truly felt that I had really lived this dream...a feeling I had never had with a dream and I remember wanting to cry because it was so real and vivid and now that I was awake, I couldnt get it back.  This has never happened again, and I always wondered if it was more than a dream.

1853,DEE,1234,24,,M,"Introduction While I read through \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven\xe2\x80\x9d I was struck by the similarity of several distinct items that were present within a spiritual experience that occurred to me. The items that Dr. Eben Alexander presented in \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven that were similar if not identical to what I experienced are as follows: 1.) Peoples clothes were natural to the environment. 2.) The experiences were perceived to be magnitudes more real than normal life. 3.) The \xe2\x80\x9cglorious chant\xe2\x80\x9d was everywhere and came from many places. 4.) A exhilarating sense of unity with all that exists. 5.) Dr. Eben Alexanders description of communication as, \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts that entered me directly\xe2\x80\x9d is similar to the direct communication with the Word of God that came upon me. The Word communicated as if through every subatomic particle field--not through words but through the Word of God. Although the religious experience written here is in dream format, the information transferred and situations experienced were of a supra consciousness nature. The religious experience developed as an independent psychological process over a twenty year period--from adolescence to adulthood. The religious experience happened to me at age 24 on September 03, 1979. I am 57 years old. Since I was 24 years old I have had no extraordinary psychological experiences. Personal experiences with direct spiritual development of consciousness are eternal and transcend both living experiences and after death experiences. Heaven is not strictly an after death state and something, perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic mind,\xe2\x80\x9d interacts with the human brain and shares some obscure affinity with each human mind. In a sense \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d is omnipresent; heaven is all around us but we typically fail to see it. Both living and after death experiences attest to this fact. This experience is of the living variety.  The Trances From age 4 through 21 I had experienced approximately 10 trances that would take me to what seemed like another dimension. My first recollection, of two symbols that appeared in one form or another throughout the trances and in the religious experience, was from a time as a kid with high fever. I saw two sparkling nuns that were walking along an infinite seashore. Children were playing beneath a sun umbrella and fragile autumn leaves blew across the sand. I perceived an infinitely dense black line coming from the sky to crush the leaves, the sun umbrella and the children. I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe line. the line\xe2\x80\x9d as my mother put cold water and rubbing alcohol on my forehead to reduce the fever. The trances stopped occurring during fever (associated with illness) around 10 years old. But I would try to stay awake by watching T.V. late into the night because I knew the trance would take place if I fell asleep and that scared me. Usually when the trance started Id get up out of bed and sit in a chair. The experience then caused the world to fade out. The walls of the room would disappear and a dark space with two huge dense masses of sparkling energy would transfer their energy back and forth through a sparkling, connecting line along which the energy flowed. I had no recognition of my presence. When the one mass would become infinitesimal to the point of disappearing, the other would become dense and heavy. Then I would become frightened. But, eventually, the energy would transfer out of the dense and heavy sparkling mass along the line and back into the one that almost disappeared. The last few times, around 20 years old, when I experienced the trances, the episodes were witnessed without fear. Id get up out of bed, sit on a couch and simply watch the show. Afterwords, I thought that was really strange but it didnt make any sense so I didnt think much of it. When I was 24 years old, at a time when my mind was biologically mature, I had a profound religious experience that seemed to be the end result of the trances. It was in the form of a dream that I could understand. Although this experience was in dream-like symbolism. I experienced it far greater than waking life experiences. Perception and emotion while in it had been enhanced. I often referred to an increase of reality to a magnitude of 10 when recounting the experience. Carl Jung stated that what acts is actual and this experience was actually the most intense experience in my life. Like a dream that you try to recall, while it fades away with the more time that passes between waking and the writing of it, much of the details escaped my memory at the time of writing it. I was in tears and quite overwhelmed upon waking but some parts of the dream that I remember and wrote are still remembered along with the emotional intensity as evidenced in my consistent effort",,US Citize,2001 2,spiritual,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,dail,week,very strong,avera,"0 24,999",some,Machini,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

1857,ME ,1440,21,,F,"Dear Dr. Alexander, Thank you so much for your book, Proof of Heaven. I have not had a NDE, but I experience a variety of connections with/in my own body. I thought I would share them with you so that you might be able to incorporate these ideas and implications into the knowledge you now possess. Mini-bio: I am 32 years old, lesbian, a former college athlete, white, middle-class/U.S., non-religious. When I was in my teens, I was inexplicably drawn to spiritual books for the greater part of 2-3 years, and then that continued into college (previously, I detested reading anything). There was no explanation for this; I detested organized religion as well. I read books by Brian Weiss Many Lives, Many Masters; Charles Tart (actually flew to California to see him speak); Gary Schwartz, among many others. I found myself reading anything and everything I could find on reincarnation, psychics, NDEs, mystical ideas and the like. As I read more, it seemed like the reading experience was such that the more I read, the deeper I went into things I already knew...and that is what kept me reading. In part, I also think that I connected this knowledge with a more sociological knowledge of the body/spirit, particularly by way of sexuality since I was also, simultaneously, coming into the awakening of my sexuality and the relationship between aesthetic experience and physical sensation. For me, there was this immediate connection between sexuality and spirituality. At any rate, I went on in college to major in psychology, sociology, and religion/philosophy. I was one of the very few students in school that defended the reality of psi phenomenon, having never literally not really experienced it myself up to that point. I read the stories and just knew they were real. As I read more, and defended the idea more and more, I began to experience more in the way of expanded consciousness. All of this started shortly after this 2-3 year stint of reading. My clairvoyance is somehow limited by time; I know things are going to happen and Im informed of them, but only about 10 minutes prior. I receive information/images in the waking state in the form of symbolic interactions i.e. ideas are communicated by the meaning my psyche will construct if I cogitate about what very material relations actually mean or feel like specifically to me i.e. the particular is what carries the universal intent of the message/the lesson. In your terminology, I think that is my bodys way of adapting to the inflow of messages that it knows are from the outside. Most often, it goes like this: I will be receiving information that I can feel is information coming through and I will pay very close attention to the content because I know it is not just my own random thoughts (i.e. I would probably be a good receiver in telepathic studies). I will then obsess about what I can make of the structural relations of that content in the very context of my theoretical/sociological categories/knowledge...because it seems to me that it is in figuring out that puzzle that explains why it is that Im receiving that message. Sometimes I can figure out who it needs to reach. I guess this ties in with the quotation on your website that all thoughts and actions are interconnected...and that is true at every level. Story 2: Although it may have nothing or everything do with me, the night I was on my bed studying, crying, and mourning my deceased cousin who died the night prior she came to visit me by staging a physical impossibility... because she knew that would register to me (Im also a very scientific mind I see the possible by way of the impossible. My family makes fun of me for always asking for percentages and probabilities in all aspects of life). :) Anyway, the night prior to this, I remember the light bulb above my bed blowing out I could hear the filament hit the glass of the bulb. Nonetheless, I had left the light switch up/circuit open. As I was sitting there crying the second night, thinking about Beth, and feeling guilty that we had not connected more the year before when she requested that, the light illuminated in a fashion akin to those lights that very gradually get brighter/lighter by touch. It lasted for about 10 seconds. It illuminated in a way that is not possible given the type of light it is; it wasnt on a dimmer switch. And the visual was as if a blast of energy had simply traveled through the space. I know to a degree of 100% that this light bulb had totally and completely blown out the night prior.

1862,ADC,1514,40,,F,"I was sleeping with my 9 year old son, Connor. My brother, Tripp, came to wake me up to tell me that my step-mother had called to tell him my father had passed away. I believe the time was 2:36 a.m. or close to that. When Tripp whispered to my from the hallway, I immediately jolted awake. I knew why he was waking me. He told me that he was going to my dads house, but that I should not go. I went downstairs to tell my husband that my dad had passed. Looking back, I was very calm. I was not crying or upset. My dad and I had an extremely close relationship. I was wide awake, so it was not that I wasnt fully understanding, I just wasnt upset for some reason. I went back upstairs and quietly got back in bed so as not to wake up my son. As soon as I lay back down, I fell back to sleep with no problem at all. (Another thing that seems strange given the situation.) It seems as soon as I feel asleep, I wasnt really sleep anymore, but sitting on my couch at my own home in Savannah. I looked up from my couch down the hall to my front door. Our front door has glass panes in it. Through the panes, I could see my dad standing there. He looked young like he did when I was a little girl. He had on seersucker pants, a starched white shirt and a bright yellow tie. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I slowly walked to the door. Time seemed to go very slowly. He was patiently waiting and just smiling at me through the glass, his eyes never leaving mine. As I made my way to the door, I knew that he shouldnt be there. I also wondered how I got from the bed at my brothers house to my house in Savannah. I knew that he was gone and should not be here on earth. As I opened the door, he smiled, and said, Hey there, Sweet Girl...I promised you I would come back to see you in Savannah. I just stood there for what seemed like a long time and then slowly walked to him and started to hug him, but then I remembered the pain it caused when I hugged him because of the tumors in his abdomen. But he sensed my hesitation, and said, It is OK Sweet Girl. You cant hurt me anymore. There is no more pain. Then he walked through the front door, into my foyer and straight up my staircase where he just kind of vanished...I stood and watched him walk away, then I just immediately woke up, and I was wide awake, and the dream was as real and vivid as if I had just been standing at my front door. I was not groggy at all or scared or sad. I was so happy and comforted that he had come to me. I could still feel our hug. I looked at the clock and less than 40 minutes had passed since my brother had come in to tell me that my dad had passed away. I lay there for over an hour replaying the dream.

I understood the conditions requisites, if you will to transcending the personality.

1866,DEE,1540,47,,F,"I lost my father to lung cancer in December 2015. My dad was one of the two people I love more in the world. The experience was tearing, painful beyond words, also due the feeling of being abandoned in the hospice with my dad by the rest of the family, who I felt like they just wanted to get it done and over with. I have never felt more lost, alone and helpless in my life and I could not understand how this could be happening to a loving person like my dad. About 6 months later something very unique happened to me and I still can not make sense of it. I know I had been thinking about my dad that morning, desperately asking him to let me know if he was ok, like I was doing almost every day. I was standing in front of the mirror getting ready for work when I realized that I could see clearly only directly in front of me, while to both sides reality appeared to be melting into some sort of vertical waves. I had the strong feeling of some sort of presence, but at the same time I was getting increasingly scared that something was seriously wrong with me. The experience must have lasted more than 20 seconds, but this is just a guess. As I turned around to go downstairs to ask for help my vision and the room went back to normal. I now wish I did not get so worried because by doing so I might have stopped the experience. Since then I have tried many times to bring back those moments as I really would like to know what all of that was, but with no success. I have read many STE but I have not found anything similar to what I have experienced. I know that whatever it was it was real and I have not imagined it.

1884,ADC,1153,44,,F,"My best friend passed into Spirit on May 15, 2004 at the age of 45, after a 10 year battle with HER-2 Breast Cancer. We had spent 40 years weaving the fabric of our lives together in a dance that was just magical. Ours is a long story of love and friendship. It is hard to relay in a few words the significance of this miracle,but I will try.  Two years ago Karen started having massive headaches and was feeling weird. We were headed off to a healing weekend in New York State and having a grand time. It was just the two of us tooling around in the car and laughing and enjoying each others company. At one point, she became very serious and told me she thought her chemotherapy may be causing these symptoms. She was struggling as to whether or not to go off the chemo and just let God do His work. I told her this was a huge decision and one not to be taken lightly. I am a big believer in asking God to give us a sign when we need an answer to an important or not so important question. Because this was a VERY important question, I told her she needed to ask for a sign that would be unquestionable! Something so unusual that it could only be from God. I then said, How about if we see a green donkey? Then you can go off chemotherapy. She giggled and said, That sounds great. The rest of the weekend we searched for a green donkey. We found yellow pigs, purple cows, red dogs and even a green horse.How we tried to rationalize that a horse is almost a donkey. But we knew it had to be a Green Donkey. We even spent the next afternoon in Woodstock, NY going through every store but never found a green donkey. A week later the headaches continued and she went for an MRI. Her father also passed away from Alzheimers this same week. On the morning of his funeral, she received a phone call from her oncologist telling her the cancer had spread to her brain. She went through the whole day, a huge funeral, and never told a soul except her husband what she had found out that morning. She had courage beyond human strength. She made it through brain surgery and massive radiation and lived two more years. She passed on May 15, 2004 surrounded by her whole family. What follows is what I said at her memorial service (which 700 people attended). Notice the part about the green donkey toward the end. I have had the pleasure of knowing Karen for over 40 years and calling her one of my best and dearest friends. But I know I am just one of countless best friends that Karen had...there was something about her that just made you want to be close to her and know her better. To Karens family...she was a mom, a wife, a sister, a daughter, and a cousin, but for the vast majority of us here today, she was our friend. A friend of the truest sense and one that was there for each of us no matter what was going on in her life. Remarkable, selfless, trustworthy, sincere, kind, compassionate, spiritual, and beautiful are words that can only begin to describe Karen. Besides being a friend,Karen was a teacher. She taught me more about strength and courage than I ever wanted to know. When my son deployed to Afghanistan last Oct, she came to me one day like an angel sent from God. She held me, cried with me and instilled in me The Power of Now. This gave me strength that I did not know I had. If I can take one tenth of her strength and live the rest of my life, then I will be happy. I will miss her human presence more than I can even imagine at this time... her spirit while she was on this Earth was immeasurable. What I look forward to from this day on is how she will guide, love, and watch over each of us in her new found strength in SPIRIT. And so I say to you my dear Karen, Godspeed to you on this new journey you have undertaken. I know Daddy was holding your green donkey and that now you know all the Divine Order that is so hard for us to understand here on Earth. I giggle at the thought of our next life together and I ask you Sister Karen to hold down the abbey until I get there. When I returned home from her service that evening, there was a message on my answering machine from my son, who was in Afghanistan, serving in the US Army. He had never, ever called on a weeknight since he had deployed, until that night. This in and of itself spoke volumes to me. I was sad I had missed his call, but I knew he was OK and surely sending me some love from afar, even though he did not know of Karens death yet.

1891,ADC,1434,45,,F,"Wish you were here. (a poem) You would love this place Dad, this forest mountain trail meandering past turquoise glacier lakes, cutting across a steep treeless loose-gravel scree. The path turns to switchback up a bare-dirt shoulder smoothed by winter\xe2\x80\x99s snow melting. At the crest, suddenly the view opens up expansive, to all horizons like the Swiss Alps. The whole Cascade range is carved at my feet: vivid green chasms, peaks painted white, no hint of civilization.  A pure sky of small cotton ball clouds streams from the horizon directly toward me, and I have to brace against this wild steady wind that spurs an endless herd of white stallions. Suddenly close and larger when leaping over this ridge, they tuck their legs at the last minute, skirting these wind-braced gnarled trees and my hand stretching up.  I used to tag along on your weekend hikes to places like this, your sanctuary. Me scurrying behind with little legs, trying to keep up with your tall, long easy strides. Death is the mystery, but I can sense you here now, Dad, in the mountains. Forgiveness allows my heart to expand; love created this place and is greater than space and time.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t hike like you did, I mountain bike. I pick up my machine here to ride back down, put on a helmet and earbuds for my Ipod. Swooping down the trail weaving through banked turns, speed and reactions are too quick for thought: rocks, a few feet of air. Me and two wheels quietly carve turns around huge ancient cedars skyscraper tall, their wizened moss-bearded branches sleepily brush puffy mist above. A postcard-intense azure sky between their reddish-brown trunks. A rush flying weightless through adrenaline-fueled bliss, this is my cathedral.  As I ride, a favorite song by Incubus always makes me think of you. It has become my prayer, telling you I am ok now.   I dig my toes into the sand,   the ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket   I lean against the wind   Pretend that I am weightless   And in this moment I am happy.   I Wish You Were Here\xe2\x80\xa6.     I lay my head onto the sand.   The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it.   Im counting ufos.   I signal them with my lighter   and in this moment i am happy,  I had a rare chance to visit your grave, passing through on my motorcycle. So many years ago this dot on a map, a hiccup in a straight flat line, was the stifling world I escaped at eighteen. Now its just a hot, dusty-small, freeway town. Surreally, everyone is a stranger. An earlier self\xe2\x80\x99s memories are just a story, gratefully too distant for emotions. The gravel road turns behind juvenile hall where I waited for my new foster mom after you died. The tiny catholic cemetery holds a few hundred family histories, a white, white statue, larger than life, divides two centuries. Mary, weeping, holds tortured Jesus in her lap. I know, neither one of us is Catholic, but mom was. I park the motorcycle. One key with one fob, a little silver disc etched with three lines one side, three broken lines the other; I-Ching symbols for Heaven and Earth.  Two unkempt, neglected yellow rose bushes grown mis-matched almost cover your name, so I trim a few branches. Ive never believed a spirit is buried, you are not here. But this is the last place on earth our paths intersected, so where else to go? No dates on the stone, I am sorry. I was too young to remember when the funeral home asked. But I am ok now.  You would be so proud of your beautiful granddaughters. The best of all of us, together.  You would like my husband, my soulmate. With him I\xe2\x80\x99ve surfed tropical waters with whales and turtles, biked Canadian passes, found love. Your spirit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to carry the burden of our grief anymore. I am no longer in a place of confused tears. Not even here. This sunny day.  Birds practice their songs above me, sitting back on an old tree; leaves quietly stirring sunbeams. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the Hispanic graves, decorated like a party. A family has recently left, spending a few happy hours with a beloved. Shiny balloons gently sway in the breeze.  Its a relief to share the peace we both so desperately needed so long ago. Then thoughts of the remaining day start to impede. A grocery list of errands, people to visit, hours on a clock, all interrupt me to leave. From the cool mowed grass I pick up my smartphone filled with facebook and emails, then in my hand the phone plays Wish You Were Here.  Dad. Are you telling me youre ok now too? I put the phone down to be here, a little while longer.  Love is greater than space and time.

It is nothing I have ever seen before or can compare to it. There were no bright and dim stars, they were all the same. In this middle was this Golf glowing light.

I cried and trembled. Suddenly something other-wordly occurred. I saw Cloy at the end of the hallway. She came towards me into my room. I recognized her because of her outer form. I say outer form because she was translucent, yet color filled, if that makes any sense. I could see through her, yet I could recognize completely that it was her. As she came towards me I said in exclamation, Cloy!\xe2\x80\x9d  It is difficult to describe what happened after that because words cannot describe what occurred next. There simply are no words on this planet for it. All that I can say is that Cloy somehow filled me with what she feels wherever she now is. Suddenly I felt as if someone had placed a needle about two to three inches long in each and every pore over my entire body, starting at the top of my head and ending with the bottom of my toes. The needles had something in them that was the essence of pure unadulterated ecstasy. It was a joy that I have never felt in this earthly existence, and I am certain that it does not exist at the earthly level of vibrational being. The needles tingled full of warm bubbly unconditional love. It was Christmas and Valentines and Halloween all in one. It was chocolate kisses and truffles and the sweet nectar of watercress fresh out of the mountain spring. It was children\xe2\x80\x99s laughter and hugs and unity squared. I was in a state of complete euphoria and exultation that I have never before or since experienced. I was involuntarily smiling from ear to ear. I could feel myself smiling, but it was not me doing it. Seconds before I had been in utter agony. Now, I was so overcome with happiness, that the smile on my face felt permanent. I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not smiling I am being smiled!\xe2\x80\x9d  I lay in the midst of this pleasure and rapture as the needles continued to tingle and pour warm, pure, syrupy, liquid affection into my veins. The veins carried it swiftly to my major organs and I breathed tender compassion. My blood became a river of sweet adulation. I then realized that if there were a drug that could reproduce that feeling \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d be on it twenty-four-seven. As a social worker dealing with methamphetamine users, I had wondered why in the world these people would take drugs and lose everything for it. Instantaneously I knew the answer. I mean, if it feels anything like what I felt that night, I can understand why someone would sell their soul for it. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this feeling was ethereal from another realm. I could only guess that Cloy was aware of my secret agony and she was giving me the ecstatic feeling that is constantly present wherever she is to assuage my pain. The message of the feeling was one of (and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to say this in words because it was conveyed to me beyond words \xe2\x80\x93 it was communicated soul to soul, mind to mind \xe2\x80\x93 words just cheapen it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how else to describe it except with words) \xe2\x80\x9cJane, you are loved unconditionally and you are OK just the way you are. The apostles aren\xe2\x80\x99t right. The church isn\xe2\x80\x99t right. There is no right. There is no duality. Love, love, love. You are love and you are loved. There is only love.\xe2\x80\x9d   I closed my eyes and luxuriated in the heavenly tingling. Eventually it subsided. The needles slowly pulled out of my body, starting at the top of my head and finally leaving altogether through the ends of my toes. I am thankful to Cloy for showing me such support and joy.

1914,ME ,1068,21,,M,"This STE described below may seem mundane in comparison to several others Ive had in previous and later years. In my previous STEs I wasnt able to process the experiences correctly or truly appreciate their significance. However, I consider the experience Im about the share to be the most important. It has ultimately lead me to receive answers to many questions that I had accumulated in my life, up to that point. It has also lead me to a comforting state of existence. The most simplistic way I can describe the experiences is: the light was switched on, like flipping a switch for a light bulb. I had been so confused and full of important questions. Questions that my brain couldnt fathom at the time. These important questions now seemed to have attainable answers after the light was switched on. I was sitting, watching the movie in the theater. Literally, out of nowhere, my thought process evolved. it not only distressed me, but delighted me. I left the movie theater immediately, with my girlfriend. She was hysterical and upset that I couldnt give words to my emotions. I was to overwhelmed with emotion to accurately portray correct explanations. I was literally in tears the whole ride back to my parent house, about 15 miles away. I was finally able to mutter the words, I cant really describe this, I just feel a better connection with GOD!!. Immediately after I uttered those words, IMMEDIATELY, a beautiful white owl swooped in front of my car at 65MPH. Its a miracle in itself, that the owl wasnt smashed. This was instant reassurance that my feelings were profound. We stared at each other, mouths aghast. She, being a very stubborn religious person, instantly grasped my feelings. She said, wow, I understand now. When we arrived at my parents house, we discussed in depth, the implications. Neither of us really had the thought process, or capability, to understand the importance. After evolving spiritually, mentally, and emotionally, we both concur that this experience was a turning point in our cognitive evolution. The majestic quality and timing of the sighting was overwhelming. Three years earlier, my grandfather Robert Heinemann, had died. his dying, or re-birthing process, greatly affected my father and I. My grandfather was on kidney dialysis at the time. The burden on my grandmother, and his body, eventually became too much. The family decided to take him off dialysis and let him pass. I had visited him a few days before he died. He was in and out of earthly consciousness, conversing with dead friends, family members, and old acquaintances. I received the news he had died right before a high school, playoff, soccer match. I felt my grandfather during the game. I didnt feel him beside me, I felt him within me. The entire game I heard the words he had uttered to me before every game that he watched. He would say work as hard as you can and everything will pay off. This was always in the back of my head while playing games. But, this time it was different. The advice was not only in the front of my head, but had become tattooed into my soul. I played the game like a man possessed. I scored a pivotal, game tying goal. I also scored the game winning penalty kick. Walking up to the ball, before the game winning kick, was different. Spectators said the Washington rain halted. I thought of nothing. my mind was clear, pure, and focused. I wasnt thinking about my grandfathers re-birthing or losing the game. I didnt even feel my body until the ball hit the net. I then felt an overwhelming amount of joy. I knew that Grandpa Bob was within me on a spiritual level. It was amazing. In the days after this experience, I wanted to discover more. I believed in spirit, and the beyond, up until this point, but had never experienced it like this. This was personal and moving, to the point where I could barely comprehend the emotion. I thought more about the conversations he had with passed souls in the hospital. I thought more about his love and spirit within me. I thought about things that held little meaning to me, prior to his death. For three years I had put the experience in my vault. I somehow knew that I wasnt ready to fully face the answers for the questions I had. One thing did comfort me before the STEs mentioned above. I always had random run-ins with beautiful birds. The run-ins always occurred when my brain was calm and relaxed, in a meditative and comforting state. my first encounter was during our first annual family golf tournament. We decided to honor Grandpa Bob by hosting a golf event. Before my round started, we were warming up on the range. It was a beautiful Washington summer morning, very tranquil. I had another clear moment, at peace with everything. I gave thanks to Bob for allowing us to experience this day and come together.

I remember saying to myself Ill just go back to sleep and itll be all right in the morning. I fell asleep and saw I was in a tunnel which was lit up. I saw ghostly figures at the end of the tunnel beckoning me forward. Just as I got to the end of the tunnel, it began to recede and I was being drawn back to my bed. This upset me and I fought to get to the light but I couldnt. As I left, one of the ghostly figures told me that if I left I couldnt come back, that this was my only chance to go there. When I woke up, the whole experience felt like a dream, including not being able to move my jaw. I soon forgot about it. Years later when I was in my late thirties, I experienced double vision and went for an MRI. The consultant said I was fine, no problems, but that Id had a mini stroke when I was a teenager. It was then I remembered my experience. I told the consultant what had happened to me at the age of 15, (leaving out the spiritual bit) and he said that it definitely sounded like a mini stroke.

1922,SDE,1277,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

I was in a state of light reverie and prayer, conscious of a warm presence around me. Suddenly, I heard something from my other dogs (still living) kennel cab. I got down on the floor to look into the kennel and saw my deceased dog sitting upright alongside the living dog. I called her name and she came closer and I picked her up.

1934,OBE,1531,30,,F,"I must first start out by explaining that I have had OBEs my entire life, beginning when I was about 9 or 10 years old. It was at this age that I began watching tv programs about people being visited by their guardian angels, or other such spirits, who had saved their lives, or sent these people messages of some monumental significance.  I was very much affected by these programs and began praying to god, or to whoever was listening to me, for some sign of the \xe2\x80\x98other side,\xe2\x80\x99 because I knew deep inside that there was more to life and I wanted to experience it firsthand as these other people did. I prayed every day obsessively and even created my own Ouija board out of paper and a ring, thinking I could make some sort of connection. The ring did eventually move, to my astonishment, but it was just my own energy that I was becoming aware of. So I began to feel my own energy throughout my body, as I do to this day, although for some time I believed it was a spirit taking over my body because it felt so foreign at the time, and as a young child I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better.  Shortly after being aware of my own energy I began to feel my energy leave my body at night when I was falling asleep.  It was incredibly startling and disturbing, as it would jolt me awake, just as I was beginning to fall asleep. As I would awaken my energy would immediately slam back into my body. As a child I thought this was the devil taking my soul away, and I used to cry and pray to god at night. This happened all the time, and it was very frightening, and there was no one I could tell because I knew I would sound crazy. One night when I was crying and praying, I suddenly felt \xe2\x80\x93and had the image of- someone kissing my cheek. I felt the energy touch my face and sink into my skin- and then I felt an immense, overwhelming wave of intense love encompass my entire body, and I knew in my soul that I was loved and taken care of, that I was perfectly safe. I was in complete shock, and my tears turned to tears of joy- someone had responded to my prayers! I knew I was going to be ok! Somehow whatever was happening to me at night was not as horrible as I thought it was\xe2\x80\xa6and so I let it happen, knowing I was protected. I was so stunned by what happened-I had truly made a connection, the connection I had been yearning for. I knew there was more to this life, I knew there was nothing to fear, that someone or something was looking out for me. My fear of evil dissipated. I got used to feeling my energy leave my body at night, and it became a familiar sensation. Years later I would meet a friend in high school who would explain me that what I was experiencing was astral projection, and I would read books on the subject, as well as on many other metaphysical topics. As a teenager I would meditate and consciously expand my awareness, teaching myself to experience that profound love again and again, I would see auras, and have many other eye-opening spiritual experiences.  Throughout the years I have experienced OBEs in my dreams quite often, where I am flying around outside, in my house, out in space, all over the place. It is a fabulous feeling. I have not been able to consciously leave my body, though-only in dreams. As an adult I am very spiritual but I do not believe in any one religion or doctrine, nor in any god, heaven or hell, or in evil. I believe in my experiences, and in a profound and universal love that we are all a part of, not separate from, because of what I have felt and witnessed in my lifetime over and over again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 20 yrs old, and I was on lithium for 10 years when we come to the present time when this story unfolds, in July of 2013. There are many other events surrounding my experience I am to speak of, which are important to mention. At the time I most likely had lithium toxicity, as I was physically sick and severely confused, and my body was in convulsions for what seemed like weeks. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat very well on my own due to the spasms and it took me an immense amount of time to get dressed and perform normal tasks due to the uncontrollable spasms caused by lithium toxicity. I never knew what day it was it was or what had even happened the day before. I was in bad shape. At the same time I was also malnourished for reasons I can only speculate onmy boyfriend had recently broken up with me so I had fallen into a deep depression, I was hardly eating, forgetting to take my meds, and hardly sleeping.

I swam out and got the first two to safety. I then returned to the heavy surf for the third victim. I got to approximately 20 yards from shore when I was unable to go any further and rested with the victim on a small sandbar. The victim was then put in a rubber life raft when I was unexpectedly swept off the bar by the heavy surf. They were unable to rescue me and I submerged under the surf. Documented reports vary as to the length of time I was submerged but were consistent that I had drowned. While submerged, I have a distinct memory of seeing and hearing my father saying to grab my knees and ball up (NOTE: my father had been deceased for 10 years).

1939,DEE,1062,39,,F,"My first memory after the surgery was awakening in a very dark room and I was completely worn out from being cold. I was still shivering and all I could think about was being warm again. I was in a warming-type tube that was pumping hot air to warm me up. I have no idea of the time or how long I was drifting in and out of sleep. As I was lying there freezing &amp; shivering, I clearly remember that while my eyes were closed the light came on in the room. Instantly I was warm. I remember thinking, oh wow, I am finally warm. I was so relaxed and relieved to not be shivering. I was literally lying there basking in this warm light feeling so wonderful! At some point my logical side asked the question of who turned on the light? When I opened my eyes the entire room was filled with a brilliant light. What I remember very well was that this light although very bright, did not hurt my eyes. The light was beautiful, peaceful, pure. It is difficult to have the proper adjectives to describe this light. At some point I began looking around the room. Sitting at the foot of my bed was the figure of a man. I could not see his face as the light appeared to be radiating from behind Him. I knew without a doubt that this man was someone very important and spiritual. I felt no fear and had complete understanding at the time that I was in the presence of someone from heaven. Without speaking the way we do here on earth, He spoke to me. He said 4 very clear sentences to me. 1. You are going to be alright. 2. I have work for you to do. (I then asked, What kind of work? I will do anything.) 3. In My own time. 4. Now rest my child. It seemed that within a few seconds after the final message, the light went away and I immediately began shivering again and was cold.  I glanced over at my sleeping husband and said, did you see him? He looked at me as if I were crazy. I remember thinking that I had dreamt this but it was so very real, so physical and so peaceful. I was unable to really talk about this experience for a very long time. When I was able to share it, it was very, very emotional for me. I felt unworthy of this visit. Why me?  I also felt a profound peace concerning death.

Although I never met my grandfather he died before I was born I immediately recognized him. I smelled a distinctive smell very clean with a slight tang of either a spicy aftershave or pipe tobacco, like the really nice scent you may experience passing a fine tobacconists shop. My mother later told me that is what my grandfather smelled like. He stopped the car my feet were not on any pedals, nor was I still steering. He looked me in the eye and I heard a clear voice but inside my head, not through my ears telling me to pull into the parking lot and take a nap. He told me not to think about setting an alarm and that I would wake up when I was sufficiently rested to drive again. He also said to eat a decent breakfast before leaving, and told me exactly where to park just outside the diner in what he called a safe spot.

1941,ME ,1406,55,,M,"  In 1954 I was born in Astoria Queens, NYC and brought up in the Diocese of Brooklyn. I attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel School and Church. My family moved to Northern New Jersey and I finished my Catholic School in Immaculate Conception in Franklin NJ Diocese of Patterson. To my parents credit one can see where the foundation of my Catholic Faith was formed. I was dragged to church. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there so eventually when I was old enough I left. I lived a very sinful life. One can only imagine where I was but I was not with God. I joined the Navy and began to become an adult and my world did not include God. Things happened to me that in retrospect God must have chose me for better things because my Guardian Angle was very busy.  I met Protestants, while in the Navy. These people were FIRED UP FOR THE LORD. They were obnoxious thumping their Bibles. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them. Finally in 1975 I associated with them enough that in Key West Baptist Church I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. The evil one still had a hold on me and I soon returned to my secular and sinful way of life. As we headed east for Desert Storm in 1990 there were definately more Christians than I have ever seen on an Aircraft Carrier before in my life. History is what it is with that war. Prayer works. Never doubt it.   I did get married to Paula in 1982 in St. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s Church in Sussex NJ. We had a good life as a Navy couple. We attended Mass sometimes mostly non-denominational services. For some reason I developed an attitude toward the Catholic Church.  I retired from the Navy in 1999 and by 2003 we found ourselves in Warrenton VA attending the Warrenton Presbyterian Church. Make no mistake the Pastor and congregation of Warrenton Presbyterian are blessed people. I had attended a Methodist Church for a couple of years, while living in NY so going to church now in my life became a necessary event. But I still was not dedicated to it. I had a Protestant perspective on forgiveness, which is what the Bible says happens if we repent; That is what I was taught by Protestants, however it still is not the teaching of the Catholic Church.  Life was good life was bad. I had some financial difficulties with other obstacles in life and I earnestly prayed to God that he help me get my life in order. Paula and I by the grace of Divine Providence found St. John the Evangelist church in Warrenton VA about 2006. It reminded us of our old time Catholic up bringing and we both felt like re returned home. We stayed.   Now in 2012 at age 57 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to back track. At age 54 or 55 I attended Mass during Easter. Father Cozy discussed the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Saint Faustina. I thought it was interesting that all one had to do was say this chaplet for salvation. Fr. Cozy had planted one of the larger mustard seeds of faith in me, no doubt. As a government contractor my customer was the Navy. I was able to walk the walk and talk the talk with Sailors so I excelled at my job (at least I thought I did). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I was age 55 that I bought my copy of St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary. I had to ride two large deck helicopter and aircraft carriers in a month\xe2\x80\x99s time so my travel to west coast gave me plenty of time to read the diary. I read through St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary like a novel. I eventually realized this was a 20th Century Saint talking directly to me. She was talking directly to me! Through Providence I started saying one Hail Mary a day also eventually this lead up to a full Rosary. I guess the door with no doorknob on my heart was being opened to Jesus. Things started to happen. While on one of the ships I shared a stateroom with two Harrier Pilots. They were both Catholic and noticed what I was reading. We shared some fellowship. I finished the Diary and it was like there was a bonus CD in the back of the book. The bonus was St. Faustina stayed with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say apparition in this essay, but I will say \xe2\x80\x9cheightened spiritual awareness.\xe2\x80\x9d I had this sense Sister was with me. I attended my first Divine Mercy Service that Easter and completed the novena prior to that. I was able to venerate and kiss a first class relic of St. Faustina during the service a woman had and shared with us all. It was about this time in May that I was coming home form work. I pulled in my driveway and was gathering my wits when in my interior voice. The interior voice! In my interior voice from nowhere I heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice say thank you. The voice was so beautiful and melodic. It could only be associated with Our Blessed Mother. I paused and took it in. Hopefully I said a prayer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember but I probably did.

1942,DEE,1300,23,,M,"My fathers office was divided into two spaces--a 2nd floor front office where he worked (with large windows overlooking the street below and surrounded by several multi-story apartment buildings), and the back office--a large bright kitchen/lounge area (illuminated by skylights)--connected to the front via a private 20 foot corridor. As soon as I arrived and handed my father the story, I felt that same strange feeling in my heart like I had felt a year earlier--the feeling that compelled me to pray. Not wishing a repeat of what happened a year earlier (see my other DEE entry)--I excused myself, telling my father I would wait in the back lounge while he read. My father wasnt spiritual or religious, and I was embarrassed that I suddenly felt a strange urge to pray. I entered the back lounge, and shut the door. I then got down on my knees and bowed y head to the floor for the first time in my life. And I suddenly started to weep. Like, uncontrollably sob. And words came out of my mouth that werent words from conscious intention. I was baffled to hear myself speaking the words. Why are we so bad? Why are we so bad? You have to understand,I didnt have a bad bone in my body. I was kind, and sensitive, and yet, these words were flowing from my mouth. And I felt such deep deep shame. Moments later, however, I felt a hand press down on the small of my back. I tried to left my head up to see who was there, but like my hands suck together in the previous DEE, this time my whole body was stuck to the floor. Quite literally, I was pinned there and couldnt move. Before I had a chance to be afraid, however, I suddenly felt two firm hands grasp my head, lift it off the floor, and turn it to the right. And there, beside me, was a fully manifested Celestial Being, kneeling on the floor beside me and looking compassionately into my eyes. As I previously wrote, my family wasnt religious, and I had no knowledge of religion at all. However, I immediately knew this Celestial Being was Jesus like I had known him my whole life. He was bearded, and wearing simple robes. (I no longer remember the color of the robes or the color of his eyes--I was too astonished that he was there in the room with me.) His eyes were mesmerizing--I was literally transfixed by his gaze. Where I had been sobbing moments earlier, and feeling deep shame, I suddenly felt the most incredible all-encompassing feeling of unconditional love. I wasnt scared. I was in bliss. And there wasnt anything I needed to ask. I felt as if I knew everything, as if I was everything, as if I was the Love itself. And a message was transmitted to me with this Love. You are loved. You are forgiven. You are respected. You are accepted. You are special and you are important. You are cared for, and everything is perfect. All of this transpired in a matter of seconds, and then Jesus bowed his head to the floor and prayed. And the hands that had moved my head to see Jesus, turned my head back to the floor, and continued to hold me there. The next thing I remember, my father opened the door and asked me if I was okay. No, I said. Im pinned to the floor. Please call Mom. While my father went back to the front office (there was no phone in the lounge), my experience suddenly changed dramatically. I was suddenly hearing sounds that were loud and clear and very real, but very distressing. The sounds were of emergency sirens, gunfire, and women shrieking in terror. At the same time, in my minds eye, I could see the major urban intersection near my fathers office with windows all blown out, burned out shells of cars in the street, and snipers scurrying in the shadows. I thought I was being shown a vision of the end of the world, but when I asked if that is what this was, there were no answers. Moments later, my father returned, and I found that I was able to get up off the floor. My mother was on the phone and wanted to speak with me, so I headed to the front office. However, as soon as I walked into the office and saw the large picture windows, I was immediately stricken with the most intense paranoia. I collapsed to the floor, certain that I was going to get shot by a sniper (probably connected to the frightening vision I had moments earlier). Long story not as long, this paranoia lasted another half hour or so during which time my father managed to get me into his car and drive me to his house (my old family house where the previously reported DEE took place). Once I got home, and was under the care of my mother, the paranoia dissipated. However, it transformed into a mania that lasted for another 40 hours or so, during which time I believed I knew everything about everything, wrote many things about God and life, and couldnt sleep. Finally, after about 40 hours, I crashed and slept for 16 hours.

Wen I looked around and no one was there I was startled and started screaming.

That instant all the memories of my dad explaining he had been visited by his angel had flashed into my mind and I panicked and said ok and went back into my room.

1945,NDE,1098,37,,F," I started drifting off and could only vaguely hear them now.  I found myself floating down a long tunnel. I looked all around and was aware of a soft and mesmerizing light at the end. I wanted to rush towards it but found it hard to move forward and could do so only by forcing myself forward half swimming, half walking. Then, I heard a distant faint voice cry out \xe2\x80\x9cSinus rhythm collapsing, we are losing her\xe2\x80\x9d but I felt completely disinterested in this. Who was being lost? I did not know who they were talking about and was annoyed at the interruption. Now I only had eyes for the wonderful glowing light at the end of the tunnel which seemed to hold promise of great warmth and love unending. I felt so joyful and excited and all awareness of my body on the bed left me as I tried for some time to reach the light. I knew absolutely that wonderful things were awaiting, if I could only get to the end of the tunnel. The light now loomed larger and I could see faint outlines of figures waiting there, beckoning me forwards. I wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is waiting there, is it Sai Baba, angels or loved ones?\xe2\x80\x9d I tried harder and harder to reach the end of the tunnel.  Then, a very faint voice interrupted my travels with a tiny urgent \xe2\x80\x9cBaby on Board\xe2\x80\x9d and a pleading \xe2\x80\x9cBreathe! You must breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. (A nurse was apparently shouting loudly into my ear). This caught my attention. I stopped in the middle of the tunnel and wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho has a baby on board, who should be breathing?\xe2\x80\x9d And then thought \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is me, perhaps I am pregnant, if I am, then I must go back\xe2\x80\x9d and I turned reluctantly around. It was so hard to leave that wonderful promise of all-encompassing Love and Joy waiting in the Light and those light filled beings waiting there. The return down the tunnel was brutally sudden. I came back to consciousness to experience total chaos, doctors were shouting and my whole body was in pain. I felt icy cold, but I could see I was indeed pregnant. My memories flooded back and I knew I had many children and others who needed me to hold on. I fought to come back and although the heart rhythm was still unstable, immediately went into labour. Serious faced heart specialists told me \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t have the baby yet, we will deliver in two weeks when your heart has settled down\xe2\x80\x9d. I did not argue, I could see their point, but I knew from my previous eight deliveries that this labour was not a trial run. So exhausted, I steeled myself for a long night. Whether it was the right time or not, this baby was on its way. I was informed later that day, that I had flat lined for some time and that had this episode happened at our house, some one hours drive from the nearest hospital, both William and I would have died. I reflected on that urgent message in the morning, no wonder I had to get to hospital that day. How strange the many delays that had led to the nurse colliding with the heart specialist! I realized that I had been somehow protected all the way through this crisis. I also felt enormous gratitude for the nurse who had shouted in my ear, because I realized that I had only turned back because of her prompting as all knowledge of my present life had been wiped out. At dawn the following morning with labour well advanced, a grim faced team of Heart specialists and surgeons gathered to deliver the baby. I was hooked to a bank of heart monitors, and had needles in my feet, arms and hands. The recalcitrant heart was still racing and wobbling around. Their ominous expressions told me that they didnt give much for our chances under anaesthetic.   Would you like to leave any messages? I was asked. None, I replied. My husband and children knew I loved them, I told them that every day. Since seeing the two little boys standing together on that planet four years earlier in the OOBE, I felt sure that William at least, would survive to be with his brother. As the anesthetic took hold, I felt totally at peace, after all I had come close to the Light and it was so wonderful, I had no fear of death left. William was delivered with only minor difficulties apparently unharmed by his pre-natal adventure in the Star Trek ship!

1946,OBE,1392,22,,M,"This story is an account of an amazing venture into the future that came about by what I, years later, came to know as a Near Death Experience. Although I wasnt physically near death at the time, I experienced all the earmarks of a classic Near Death Experience, including leaving my physical body and traveling at tremendous speeds through a variety of mystical dimensions.   A Window in Time By Joe   The cold March rain dripped steadily off the back porch awning as I ran water for my morning coffee. Through the kitchen window I could see streaks of snow across the muddy back yard. Where the yard ended and the dark gray bark of maple trees along the hillside took over, the snow still covered all the land. The phone rang. Setting down the coffee pot, I reached for the phone. Hello. I said. You wanna meet for lunch? Jim asked without even bothering to say hello. Sure, I replied. Anything to get me out and away from the boredom. We exchanged a few more words and hung up. I put the coffee pot on the stove, grabbed a quick shower, put on a sweatshirt, poured myself a cup of coffee, and sat down to read a couple chapters from an Eric Von Daniken book I had just picked up the day before. A couple hours later, I put on a rainproof windbreaker and headed for town. When I arrived at Charlies Lounge, Jim was already there. Whats the special?, I asked the bartender.  Burger and fries, he said. Good enough for me, I replied. Put some cheese on it too. Jim looked over and smiled. You wanna beer? Ah, its a little early for that I said. Come on, one with lunch wont hurt you. he said. Get him a draught, he said to the bartender. Jim was a road construction worker who hadnt been working for the past couple weeks due to the incessant rain. Id known him since we were kids. His boredom wasnt as intense as mine, but the cold, dreary rain was getting a lot of people down in this tiny Pennsylvania railroad town. It was a tough little town along the edge of the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania. The heart of Appalachia was just a few minutes away. The Vietnam War was just winding down and Watergate was front page news every day. Life, like the weather, was bleak. A month earlier I had finished a two year stint as a Military Policeman in Germany.  I was accustomed to the excitement of constant stimulation. As a policeman I had weathered the drama and tragedy of the Munich Olympics, witnessed first hand the violence of the militant Baader-Meinhof Gang, and while wearing the white hat of law enforcement, had been front and center in the unpredictable and dangerous world of heroin addiction. Okay, Ill sip on a beer, I said to the bartender. Jim smiled. When I looked in his direction I could see a couple guys playing a game of pool. Immediately my radar went off. Two brothers were playing a game of eightball. One of the brothers was a year older than me, and had been a superb football player. The other brother was a year younger than me and had always been a bit of a troublemaker. And, he was drunk! It just past noon and he was drunker than a skunk. Several years earlier, I had been in an all out fight with the younger one. I had knocked him down and was on top of him, pounding the living daylights out of him when someone pulled me off.  Here he was again. Drunk, and this time with his older brother, who it appeared he was going to try and impress. He was staring at me. His face was getting red. I could feel my adrenalin surging. Every drop of testosterone in my body was lit up. The two years in the military had added 30 pounds of muscle to my body. I had been trained in judo and self defense techniques. I was capable of putting anyone into submission in seconds. I was ready! To avoid initiating any confrontation and to maintain my focus, I chose to gaze at the cue ball(the all white pool ball) as it bounded around the pool table. A moment went by, then two. I kept my focus on the cue ball. I began developing a slightly different mind set. I clearly remembering saying to myself, I choose to not allow my emotions to dictate my actions. I choose to just stay focused on the neutral cue ball. Then BOOM, it happened. Suddenly, without warning, my entire state of consciousness shot directly out of the top of my head. Everything I knew to be me was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and accelerating by the second. At first I seemed to have shot through a tunnel like zone, then into a brightly lit world. I went past cities, land masses, continents, entire worlds. and universes. I clearly remember seeing a great River. I remember thinking at the time that it must be the River that St John spoke of in Revelations. I remember clearly because, at the time, I was a dyed in the wool atheist. But I didnt stop there.

I didnt want to offend or do that wrong thing! She told me to drink it! But it understood immediately that it was to be just a small amount, I was not to drink the entire thing.

I didnt feel it was God or Jesus but someone other. The presence had humor and was kind. I was asked what I wanted to do with my life and asked to dig deep. When asked if I wanted to stay I was ambivilant and asked what I REALLY wanted and why. I realized I needed to get back as my mother would be destroyed if I died. She had had multiple miscarriages and lost a live birth boy. If she lose me her only living child, shed be a mess. As soon as I realized this I woke up in the car.

Startled, yet at peace, looked up to see the deceased form of one of my fathers closest friends, a small town surgeon. Dr. Pauls hands went to the small of my back while simultaneously radiating incredible warmth and energy into the damaged lumbar area. I clearly proclaimed, I miss you Dr. Paul. He smiled, and after standing there for what seemed an eternity, drew his hands from my back, stepped away slowly and faded before my eyes. I immediately arose and went to my desk. For two hours I sat motionless while I recounted vivid memories of the man who had helped a boy whose father was killed when I was eight years old. Not until I stood up, did I realize that my back pain was completely gone, and had no idea that I would be pain free for the next ten years. I shall never forget Dr. Paul Myers.

Its more LOVE than anyone could imagine exists and yet it did, and along with that LOVE was LIGHT the most intense but INVISIBLE LIGHT anyone could ever witness, it was invisible but it was as bright as bright could be. The intensity of the LOVE and the LIGHT flowing from this MAGNIFICENT BEING was beyond what my mind could grasp. I couldnt look at it, I turned my face slightly away, although this was all happening within me, I turned it slightly away because what I was seeing and what I was experiencing stunned my human mind, stunned it because the beauty of it, the transcendence of it and the LOVE itself was beyond human imagination.

1957,ME ,1284,36,,F,"Synchronicity \xe2\x80\x93 This is my calling\xe2\x80\xa6Why the mental health system is antiquated, and why we need to stop pretending we\xe2\x80\x99re robots in a naturally spiritual world. After years of searching for my life purpose it was handed to me on a plate, quite literally from the Universe straight into my head, like a light bulb suddenly being switched on in a deep dark cave of confusion. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t lose me here, you may be thinking: \xe2\x80\x98so who are you and what do you know about re-evaluating the conceptual framework around mental illness or achieving universal peace?\xe2\x80\x99 That is exactly what I thought when the information came to me; I am no Professor or academic guru. That is the point, this has nothing to do with who I am, I have been given this message to prove that anybody of any intellect or social standing can tap into the psychic realm and see a universal truth; all you have to do is ask the question and then believe in the answer.  I have been told by spirit that the mental health system in our Western society desperately needs modifying in terms of spiritual experience. Mental distress is actually a fallacy of modern society which is ever increasing in line with consumerism and will continue to do so unless we acknowledge the problems we are creating. We must see mental distress of any kind with new eyes if human evolution is going to continue in the way it is meant. Mental distress originates in fear, a fear lodged in our past that we carry with us into the present, and project into the future, a destructive fear from which we can be free, individually, and so, universally. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s the irony:My fear of speaking out about this message and how it came to me \xe2\x80\x93 the message that it is fear that stops mankind achieving mental wellbeing, happiness and fundamentally Universal peace \xe2\x80\x93 nearly stopped me from following my path, after years of searching! I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that I\xe2\x80\x99m not still scared, but what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were to tell everyone they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be scared, if I were too afraid to put my head above the parapet and risk being shot at? Before I had my \xe2\x80\x98experience\xe2\x80\x99 I knew nothing about spirituality, and even less about religion. So what happened was as incredulous to me as what you are going to read may sound to you! I have, however, always had good intuition and a kind of underlying \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 since childhood that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching for something that was missing, like I always knew there was another dimension even though society and my education told me otherwise. I was about 12 when I read the book \xe2\x80\x98Utopia\xe2\x80\x99 and to me it was more than just fiction, it was a possibility. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t just think it\xe2\x80\x99s achievable; I know how. It all happened when I had started to meditate at the same time as thinking more deeply about what to be \xe2\x80\x98mentally ill\xe2\x80\x99 actually means. I\xe2\x80\x99d worked within the field for long enough to know about academic theory; the nature / nurture argument and chemical imbalances. What was the truth? I started to question my own sanity, I have always been very sensitive and emotional; where do you draw the line? I am well aware that by writing this, that by voicing my beliefs that I have channelled a message from the spiritual realm, I could be seen by some working within the mental health field as being deluded or having experienced a psychotic episode. You may choose to believe that this is the rambling of an unstable mind, you may suggest that what I am saying is insane. I, however, now know that the real insanity would be for me to ignore such an important message. If I were to ignore it and deny myself my truth for fear of speaking out against a system, I know that I would become mentally distressed \xe2\x80\x93 and that is also proof enough for me to know that the message I have been given is the truth. Many people who try to speak out about their psychic experiences are told that what they are experiencing is not real; that they are \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99. So either way, if somebody has a spiritual experience they are more than likely doomed to some form of mental distress, predominantly not from the experience itself, but from either repressing it due to fear, or from believing they are going \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99 if they do dare to speak out because they are told that what is happening to them isn\xe2\x80\x99t real. The message I was given confirmed all of this. So I had been contemplating the true nature of mental illness, and whether indeed I was mentally unwell, and my brain went into overload so I decided I needed to try to relax.

1982,SDE,1308,41,,F,"After I fell to the ground and my father was with me we chatted like normal, then all of a sudden he said we have to go and see my step-mother and brother. The whole time I experienced this the beautiful warmth and light was upon me, to describe the light as best I can, is like having a massive spotlight place over you and the rim of the light is pure white and protective, inside the light is the perfect warmth, like the temperature is set to perfection. As we walked over to my step-mother I said to her please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know this, I then placed my hand just under her left shoulder and just above her breast and said Dad wants you to know he loves you with all his heart and soul the look on my step-mothers face was shock and tears welled in her eyes. We then walked over to my Brother (who had a 20 yr feud with my sister) I said to him again, please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know, with that I then placed my hand over his stomach, and said Dad understands the feud between he and my sister is deep seated within them and could they please let the past be and find a way to love each other again, my brother was also shocked....I told him again, not to be afraid. After I gave these messages to my family, we walked over to a rose garden, the whole time the light was with me and the most beautiful, euphoric feeling I can not describe was with me. In between the messages I kept repeating to Dad how beautiful it was. When we sat at the rose garden, Dad asked me if there was anything they could do (we werent allowed to tell him during the week he was dying) I said there wasnt the cancer had spread to most of his body and I just kept also repeating Look Dad, look how beautiful it is I was just in awe of it. With that he was gone and I was back to reality. I returned to the motel we were staying at, thinking that the experience was spurred on by lack of sleep or stress. I thought I was losing my mind. Later that day I returned to the Hospital and was in the kitchen when a nurse came in and I told her that I thought I had lost my mind and was it normal when a loved one was dying, I told her about what I had experienced and thinking she would agree that it was stress induced, the nurse (Paula) then stated that is exactly what Dad would experience when he does finally pass. I was shocked. We both returned to Dads room only to find he was awake and outside in the courtyard, with two other nurses beside him. We couldnt believe it. He was telling my brother, as best he could as for most of the week it was hard to make sense out of much he was saying to us, he told my brother he had enough and then looked straight at me and said I have had enough Im ready to go because its beautiful isnt it buttons (a nickname Dad callled me) I was shocked but replied with a smile and said It certainly is Dad. The most wonderful calm came across me and I knew then everything would be alright. Paula (the nurse) then placed her hand on my shoulder and said, There is your confirmation. Later the next day, we all couldnt believe it when my brother and sister were standing in Dads room, hugging each other and genuinely sharing a laugh together. I then softly whispered in Dads ear, See Dad, you did it, I heard you and they are getting along now, everything is ok and you can go now. I know he heard me as I felt a weak grip on my hand as I was holding his hand. A few days later I found out that the messages I had given to my step-mother and brother were almost identical to what my Dad was trying to say the morning I had the experience with my father. I wasnt in the room at the time.

1983,ME ,1108,19,,F,"I was just riding the subway when, out of nowhere, Jesus appeared to me. It wasnt a visual appearance, but sort of in my minds eye, yet his presence was an absolute certainty to me and I could sense him very, very powerfully. He appeared to me as he is so often depicted in European paintings, with a flowing robe, long hair, and a beard but other than that he was in a place that was entirely dark. In other words, I just saw Jesus who was otherwise surrounded by blackness he was all that mattered at that moment. He spoke only once and asked a single question which I will never forget as long I as draw breathe. He asked me, Do you want me to show you how I love you? One would think that his appearance would have surprised me, but I just took it in stride and thought to myself, sure, what the heck, what have I got to lose? I was curious, so I immediately agreed, but I never said yes aloud, but somehow communicated directly and immediately. Jesus, whose arms had been at his side, wordlessly just opened his arms wide open and instantly something happened to me. Now, there are no human words to describe what I felt next. I had the sense of absolutely pure love being poured all over me from above, sort of like being baptized with pure love. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before it was not at all HUMAN love, but far more. There was no ulterior motive, no expectation, no string attached, just pure, altruistic, unadulterated love. I immediately started to just cry and I leaned my arm on the seat in front of me and hid my face so nobody could see me crying like that. (It was Christmas Day and the train was almost completely empty. The closest person to me was half a train car away from me.) The sensation was ineffable and I felt like the luckiest human being who had ever lived. I started asking Jesus questions like, Why are you showing this to me, Im unworthy, I dont deserve it. I repeated, There are people who have been religious all their lives and havent experienced this, they deserve it, not me. Things went on like this for some time, I have no idea how long. I can only say that the total ride time from where I got on to where I exited the train was about 50 minutes and the event did not start right away, but perhaps half-way through the journey. The love just kept flowing over me, but no answer to my questions came. At times, the love pouring over me and enveloping me seemed like water flowing, at another moment, it seemed like gold coins being poured over me and it just didnt end. Gradually, I stopped crying and stopped asking questions, I just relished it and continued to feel so very luck.  Eventually, I got off the train at my station. Im not sure how long I waited for my bus or if I even waited at all. The blissful state of being divinely loved took center stage and nothing else mattered at all to me. The bus took off and I started to cry again, again hiding from others. I re-asked my questions, but still no answers. Details of the bus ride are a little unclear, but I remember there was music, too. It started early in the experience and it was as if Jesus were singing a particular song to me, one that I had liked, but not thought much about. It was a popular song from the late 60s sung by Petula Clark called My Love is Warmer than the Sunshine. It was repeating constantly in my mind, as if it were Jesus trying to find an analogy that would resonate with me. Ive copied the lyrics that just kept repeating in my mind. As I heard them sung with Petulas voice, but Jesus intentions, I thought deeply about each line and could really FEEL it somehow. They were no longer just silly lyrics from a pop song, but felt experiences of the most profound type. My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine, softer than a sigh. My love is deeper than the deepest ocean, wider than the sky. My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above. And there is nothing in this world that can ever change my love. I know the ride to my friends house took about 25 minutes, although I had no real sense of time during this event. At some point during the ride or shortly after I got off the bus and starting walking towards her place I began to wonder if the event was going to stop and, if it didnt, what I would do, how could I visit with my friend. It wasnt a terrible worry, it just occurred to me that I just couldnt function normally with what was happening to me. This is where the plot thickens. I began the walk to my friends home. It had snowed and there were icicles hanging from the trees. In my love-enveloped state, I began to look at world and it was not as I had ever seen it before. Somehow, I had the feeling that Jesus was showing me how he saw the world, but that was a guess, he wasnt talking. Somehow, it wasnt substantial, but rather all made of the same beauti",,USA    Q.,"50,000",atheist,religious,Christian,Christian,,,dail,week,moder,moder,"25,000 49",post,I was w,,single,divor,Unc,moderately str,All pleasant,youth

1987,NDE,1078,25,,M,"After the mask was placed on my face, the doctor told me to count backwards from 10. I began to count. When I got to 1, I realized I couldnt breathe. I also could not speak or move...or open my eyes.  I began to panic inside. I thought..Im going to die!  Immediately I started to try and think of something that would help me stay alive. Trapped inside my body and unable to move or speak, there werent many options. I thought that if I could just hold onto a thought with my mind, I would not die. So, I thought of a tree. I pictured a tree in my mind, imagined how it felt to be next to a tree, and kept repeating the word tree over and over.  I began to feel like I was moving through a dark tunnel. I felt afraid...and clung to my inner tree life rope as I moved along the dark passageway.  I moved through a darkness...murkiness... that included spirit like beings roaming around making some sounds... I did not recognize any of them...they were misty, grey entities floating around. I felt fear. I realized I could no longer see the word for tree in my mind...but I could still see the tree, and feel its presence.  I continued to move through the darkness and the spirits were gone. The tunnel was lighter. I had an instant awareness of my whole life...like a 360 degree view of everything about my life. It was extremely expansive knowing and deep knowledge. I no longer felt afraid. And I could no longer see the tree in my mind, but I could feel its presence. I was aware that there was a place I had traveled from...and I had family there... but I was not worried because I also knew that in the scheme of all I suddenly knew...all I was remembering had been just a flicker of time...my whole life had happened in less than a snap of my finger.  The light in the tunnel grew brighter and closer. I was travelling fast. Suddenly I burst though into a sea of Light...only Light.... I no longer felt the presence of the tree, because I realized I am the tree! I am everything! This was not a thought...but a knowing. An all expansive knowing.  The feeling was completely ecstatic...like an orgasm without a body. No body to limit the deep and ongoing BLISS. There were no words... just knowing. The knowing was The only thing that matters is Love... all Love It was timeless and so pure. The direct experience of Divine Love Then I became aware of something forming... like a vibration. I realized it was a thought coming into form... and the thought was: What about my son? (I had a 5 month old son at home) As soon as the vibration became a thought, I immediately began travelling back through the tunnel... fast!  I woke up in the recovery room.  I didnt tell anyone for 5 years....not even my husband.  The experience has profoundly changed my life... The experience memory has never faded...it is still more real than real.

2001,ME ,1068,21,,M,"This STE described below may seem mundane in comparison to several others Ive had in previous and later years. In my previous STEs I wasnt able to process the experiences correctly or truly appreciate their significance. However, I consider the experience Im about the share to be the most important. It has ultimately lead me to receive answers to many questions that I had accumulated in my life, up to that point. It has also lead me to a comforting state of existence. The most simplistic way I can describe the experiences is: the light was switched on, like flipping a switch for a light bulb. I had been so confused and full of important questions. Questions that my brain couldnt fathom at the time. These important questions now seemed to have attainable answers after the light was switched on. I was sitting, watching the movie in the theater. Literally, out of nowhere, my thought process evolved. it not only distressed me, but delighted me. I left the movie theater immediately, with my girlfriend. She was hysterical and upset that I couldnt give words to my emotions. I was to overwhelmed with emotion to accurately portray correct explanations. I was literally in tears the whole ride back to my parent house, about 15 miles away. I was finally able to mutter the words, I cant really describe this, I just feel a better connection with GOD!!. Immediately after I uttered those words, IMMEDIATELY, a beautiful white owl swooped in front of my car at 65MPH. Its a miracle in itself, that the owl wasnt smashed. This was instant reassurance that my feelings were profound. We stared at each other, mouths aghast. She, being a very stubborn religious person, instantly grasped my feelings. She said, wow, I understand now. When we arrived at my parents house, we discussed in depth, the implications. Neither of us really had the thought process, or capability, to understand the importance. After evolving spiritually, mentally, and emotionally, we both concur that this experience was a turning point in our cognitive evolution. The majestic quality and timing of the sighting was overwhelming. Three years earlier, my grandfather Robert Heinemann, had died. his dying, or re-birthing process, greatly affected my father and I. My grandfather was on kidney dialysis at the time. The burden on my grandmother, and his body, eventually became too much. The family decided to take him off dialysis and let him pass. I had visited him a few days before he died. He was in and out of earthly consciousness, conversing with dead friends, family members, and old acquaintances. I received the news he had died right before a high school, playoff, soccer match. I felt my grandfather during the game. I didnt feel him beside me, I felt him within me. The entire game I heard the words he had uttered to me before every game that he watched. He would say work as hard as you can and everything will pay off. This was always in the back of my head while playing games. But, this time it was different. The advice was not only in the front of my head, but had become tattooed into my soul. I played the game like a man possessed. I scored a pivotal, game tying goal. I also scored the game winning penalty kick. Walking up to the ball, before the game winning kick, was different. Spectators said the Washington rain halted. I thought of nothing. my mind was clear, pure, and focused. I wasnt thinking about my grandfathers re-birthing or losing the game. I didnt even feel my body until the ball hit the net. I then felt an overwhelming amount of joy. I knew that Grandpa Bob was within me on a spiritual level. It was amazing. In the days after this experience, I wanted to discover more. I believed in spirit, and the beyond, up until this point, but had never experienced it like this. This was personal and moving, to the point where I could barely comprehend the emotion. I thought more about the conversations he had with passed souls in the hospital. I thought more about his love and spirit within me. I thought about things that held little meaning to me, prior to his death. For three years I had put the experience in my vault. I somehow knew that I wasnt ready to fully face the answers for the questions I had. One thing did comfort me before the STEs mentioned above. I always had random run-ins with beautiful birds. The run-ins always occurred when my brain was calm and relaxed, in a meditative and comforting state. my first encounter was during our first annual family golf tournament. We decided to honor Grandpa Bob by hosting a golf event. Before my round started, we were warming up on the range. It was a beautiful Washington summer morning, very tranquil. I had another clear moment, at peace with everything. I gave thanks to Bob for allowing us to experience this day and come together.

2002,OBE,1229,44,,M,"Almost immediately after taking the divine plant I began to fall out of my body. It was a wholly new sensation for me. After years of pursuing the actual out of body occurrence it was nothing as I had imagined it to be. There is noting that can compare one for the actual sensation. During numerous mediations I had always imagined myself rising above my body to look down and view myself. But this is not what actually happened. I actually fell into myself. I literally fell out of myself and by falling inside myself. And then instantly found myself floating above my body laying on the bed. The experience of being pulled out of the body was not an unpleasant sensation rather it was the first time to feel it and all firsts are usually associated with some fear. In this case it happened so fast and the train I was on had no exit routes, so I was on it for the duration. Once I was above my body the experience was quite pleasant. I was amazed at how I looked. I also notice the family cat was aware of my presence which I found quite interesting as it gazed upon my astral body. Just as I was becoming acquainted with my new surroundings I was yanked yet again in another direction at an astounding rate through a tunnel towards a light. Upon reaching the end of the tunnel I seemed to be deposited on the other side of a threshold. This place was completely and utterly spectacular. I was suddenly connected to everything was the feeling I remember most. I only needed to think of something and the associated response was with me. The communication was so much different here. I wasnt thinking in words but pictures associated with strong feelings and emotions. And I was like a newborn. I had very little experience in this new environment. It was very much a fish out of water experience. The thing that left the most lasting impression on me was this. I was able to look back on where I had just come from. The physical world. It was close. I could perceive it clearly as if it were a separate dimension but very close. I began to focus on the edges of it as it didnt seem to be wholly formed yet. The colors were so vibrant and alive.  So organic. The edges looked like caviar. And It came into me that I was perceiving the physical on a molecular level. I was so amazed. Then suddenly it came through me like a lightening bolt. These molecules perceived me. They were aware I was looking at them. Communication!! Images and information passed at an alarming rate. I was aware of the rythme and reason for everything coming into being. It filled me with a sense of joy I had never felt before. I laughed. I knew what life really was. These small bits of life....molecules...all formed based on collective thoughts. We all were creating everyday. We just didnt realize how powerful our thoughts we were. Then I was aware of a presence behind me. It was so brite and so large. My first thoughts were not of intrigue but of how small and dim I was. And just this tiny bit of hesitation flooded me with thoughts of....had I killed myself. Suddenly I was flooded with thoughts of fear. I wanted to know if I was alive. I yearned to feel my body again. So I prayed to feel my body again. And I was propelled in that direction. It was not an easy maneuver. It took some time to anchor myself in my body but it was accomplished. I had set up a timer on the side of the night stand. Total duration was 15 minutes. It had felt like an eternity. There was actually no sensation of time where I had gone. It did not exist.

My goal for this workshop was for us to get close to God and to connect with each other. On Friday, June 26, 2009 at 1:45pm, I went to a room to conduct my workshop which was to start at 2:00. I was standing by the rooms door waiting to greet people as they arrived. A man walked up to me. He was a large man, about 62. He had white hair nicely styled...bald on top, longish on the bottom. He wore a geometric-designed tent garment that covered him from neck to knee. His face was clean-shaven with pink shiny cheeks. He had this powerful and pleasant look on his face. But I was struck by his face because it was glowing. There was an unmistakable glow coming from his face, as if a light was on inside his head. I could see that the glow was of a spiritual nature. I couldnt stop staring at his face and its glow. I asked this man if he was a minister. I was wondering if he was coming to my workshop for personal or professional reasons. He was friendly and said that he wasnt a minister but that he came for personal reasons. We chatted lightly while waiting for the rest of the people. Normally about 20-25 people came to my workshop but it was 2:00 and no one else showed up. We went inside and I set up chairs in a circle. One other man came. He was a regular participant who lived in Boston. We were friendly and teased each other because he was a Red Sox fan and I was a Yankees fan. By 2:10 I could see no one else was coming. I thought it was strange. Not even my husband Hank came that day and he came to all my other workshops. This man and I immediately locked into each other, talking. I dont really remember all that we talked about. That part of the conversation was blocked from my mind. The Boston man tried to talk with us but we totally ignored him, though not with malice, so he got up and left. The man and I continued our conversation. Then this stranger said to me, Youre an E.T. Master. I looked at him for a long while. I took him seriously, thats the strange part. Whats an E.T.? I was scared to ask this question because I kind of knew what ET meant and I was afraid to hear him say those words. He paused, staring at me, You know, an extraterrestrial. My spirit and my eyes were locked with his spirit and his eyes. Oh, I think I said. Im an Angel, he matter-of-factly said to me. I believed him. I believed everything he was telling me. I wasnt afraid of him and I didnt think he was crazy. I trusted and totally believed this total stranger. Thats whats so strange. I didnt even want to come up here, he said. I have work to do and a wife and children back home in Texas. I wasnt even planning to come to your workshop. I was sleeping but a loud noise woke me up so I looked on the agenda to see what workshops were scheduled. I saw your workshop and decided to come. Now I know I was sent here to see you. Whats your name? I asked. You can call me Fred. What work do you do? Im a CPA. What am I supposed to do? What are you saying to me? I dont understand. Are there books I should read? He looked away from me and said: You will be meeting people. They will show you the way. I dont remember what else we talked about in the one to two hours we talked. But I do remember that I was spiritually locked into him, like I was spiritually locked into the glow and cross and the ghost. He got up to leave and said goodbye. I said goodbye but I didnt get up. I couldnt get up. I was just sitting there, numb-like, just staring ahead. He stopped and turned around, Are you okay? Yes, Im okay, was all I could say. I sat alone in the room not really thinking about anything. Then I returned to Hank, told him a little bit about my unusual workshop but I didnt tell him then what Fred said to me. Later that night I saw Fred one more time at a dance our event put on. As soon as I saw him I went over to give him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and I said thank you. He smiled. He didnt say anything, though. We parted and I went back to Hank and we danced the night away. I remember looking for Fred in the dance room but I never saw him again. I regret not knowing his last name or not asking for his contact information. I tried to find out more about him so I could contact him but the organizers of the event couldnt help me without a last name.

2005,DEE,1062,39,,F,"My first memory after the surgery was awakening in a very dark room and I was completely worn out from being cold. I was still shivering and all I could think about was being warm again. I was in a warming-type tube that was pumping hot air to warm me up. I have no idea of the time or how long I was drifting in and out of sleep. As I was lying there freezing &amp; shivering, I clearly remember that while my eyes were closed the light came on in the room. Instantly I was warm. I remember thinking, oh wow, I am finally warm. I was so relaxed and relieved to not be shivering. I was literally lying there basking in this warm light feeling so wonderful! At some point my logical side asked the question of who turned on the light? When I opened my eyes the entire room was filled with a brilliant light. What I remember very well was that this light although very bright, did not hurt my eyes. The light was beautiful, peaceful, pure. It is difficult to have the proper adjectives to describe this light. At some point I began looking around the room. Sitting at the foot of my bed was the figure of a man. I could not see his face as the light appeared to be radiating from behind Him. I knew without a doubt that this man was someone very important and spiritual. I felt no fear and had complete understanding at the time that I was in the presence of someone from heaven. Without speaking the way we do here on earth, He spoke to me. He said 4 very clear sentences to me. 1. You are going to be alright. 2. I have work for you to do. (I then asked, What kind of work? I will do anything.) 3. In My own time. 4. Now rest my child. It seemed that within a few seconds after the final message, the light went away and I immediately began shivering again and was cold.  I glanced over at my sleeping husband and said, did you see him? He looked at me as if I were crazy. I remember thinking that I had dreamt this but it was so very real, so physical and so peaceful. I was unable to really talk about this experience for a very long time. When I was able to share it, it was very, very emotional for me. I felt unworthy of this visit. Why me?  I also felt a profound peace concerning death. I knew without a shadow of a doubt that what I experienced was real and that when I did die, I would be going to a wonderful place where I would always be warm.

After taking Ibogaine 18.5 milligrams I began to feel dizzy and went and laid in my bed. Lights were off and all windows were darkened. I was semi sat up in bed with eyes wide open the whole experience. Post two hrs I began seeing light of all colours pour through my ceiling and into my room. I felt at the last point my body being raised and a sense of lightness. About 30 mins after all color had stopped flowing into my room where everything became kinda pixelated. I could see energy like dust particles clearly and then I could see masses of energy which quickly became vivid people in spirit. I could continue to see spirits seven in all and spiders and a big bull frog up until dusk. This the ibogaine wore off and everyone slowly disappeared again.

I have had experience with psychedelics before in the past but never experienced anything close to what happened next. I sat in a circular cozy sofa and closed my eyes and my consciousness entered a dimension where it felt as if I had tapped into an eternal network of knowledge. Bursts of ideas regarding life and its wonders popped into my consciousness like bubbles, each identifying value which could not be explained by words very easily. An understanding of love was undeniable as it clearly is the adhesive force binding all of life. I understood that life requires a balance of the extremes and that death is nothing to fear but simply the critical point where our spirits transcend the physical realm. I could not see anything worth noting but the knowledge brought to my attention introduced me to the most profound spiritual presence I could ever ask to experience.

2023,ADC,1364,25,,F,"I sat on the edge of the bed as Shawn tried to comfort me, my crying seemed to intensify with the downpour of the rain. I looked up at the ceiling in our bedroom asking God for a sign. I asked him as a Catholic, saying out loud: I have faith and I know they say he is in a better place, but I need MORE! I need PROOF that he is OKAY! And just as I shouted this at God a sudden loud bang and flash of white light filled the bedroom. Shawn and I physically jumped out of bed because the crash was so loud we thought the window was going to crash in on us. We looked at each other, puzzled. Was that for us? Because the timing was just as if God was answering my prayer. Just as that happened we began to calm down and the rain also subsided. I told Shawn that it felt like an answer from God and it was so strange. The next morning Shawn went out to our car that was parked on the street. He heard muffled music playing that grew louder as he got nearer. When he opened the car door the radio was blasting music very loud on my brothers favourite radio station. When Shawn tried to shut the radio off, it would not turn off, he had to pull the system out of its dock to make it turn off. The radio remained like that for years. The wires were fried because that night our building and our car was hit by lightening, the very lightening that crashed outside our window at the very moment I asked God for a sign / for proof that John was okay. That isnt the end of it. From then on it was like the floodgates had opened. I got all kinds of signs from John, all kinds of instances of after-death communication, including a full apparition, physical phenomenon, electronic phenomenon and I would like to share that all here. I could write my own book about all the signs John gave me and my family after his death.

I was at the point of not being able to feel many emotions, I was anxious, and waking each morning felt like more of a curse than a blessing.

I was in love but didnt know why or how, and this feeling was felt for every person I met that day, including strangers. The next morning when I woke this feeling was gone, and I was back to having no feelings at all, back in my depressed state.

He was sitting in his chair the entire time and no one else could have possibly entered the space. He told me he thought an Ascended Master was trying to use the trumpet to talk to us!

2051,ME ,1009,18,,F,"One of the weirdest things about this experience was the feeling of getting shot in the head. Actually, I didnt feel a thing, but I remember how my vision exploded in red. I remember how I vaguely felt my body hitting the ground and being unable to stop it, even as I, as a spirit, got yanked out of my body. I didnt feel a bit of pain, and Im usually very scared of blood, but I wasnt scared of the blood I saw coming out of me as I died--just intrigued, but not emotionally connected to it. As a spirit, I learned that I look very different than how I look physically. This experience taught me that I, Theresa, am actually a combination of three women who I was in other lifetimes--and I learned that we dont have to live our lifetimes in chronological order, and those lifetimes can overlap on each other, too. I learned that I, Theresa, am a combination of these three women:-a German Jewish girl who was about sixteen when she died in one of the concentration camps during the Holocaust-an American (Caucasian) woman who was in her 30s when she died in the 1980s-a Caucasian woman with shoulder-length, flaming red hair who was the captain of a starship and had died in the 2300s or thereabouts. She was in her late 20s-early 30s. Id lived all three of these lifetimes before this one. I learned that I, Theresa, am a composite of all three of these women. Im not exactly my own person. Im unique, yes--but I was created from these three women. Looking back on whats happened in the 2000s in our physical world, Im astounded that I basically saw our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan several years before they happened. Back in 1998, it was a lot easier to dismiss this experience as some really vivid dream, emphasis on dream. When I was 18, I couldnt fathom circumstances when the US would choose to wage war against anyone else. It was really easy to dismiss this aspect of my experience as something out of an action movie, perhaps. And I distinctly felt what the other soldiers were feeling--this grief over the fact that they knew, at the time of their deaths, that they would be dying so far away from home for a pointless war. The soldiers in my dream knew this full well as they died. They were extremely sad about this. If I had to describe it, it was like they had this immense, low, wailing grief--something very heavy and sad, like low, gray storm clouds. Back in 1998, one of the things that really amazed me was that the littlest promises we make are, indeed, kept. To go back to this brother of mine: We were fans of James Camerons movie, TITANIC, and we met in an email mailing list. We ended up talking a lot via IM. I dont think we ever exchanged pictures, even. But he was the first to say that he felt like I was his little sister, which was odd because he is an only child, like me. He liked calling me Sis a lot, and I called him big bro, although I dont think I felt this sibling bond quite as strongly as he did. We did talk about the supernatural, and about life beyond death. He talked about being in the US Army for some period of time. I dont know how our conversations got to this point, but we made a promise to each other: that if it really was true that there was life beyond death, whoever would die first would go to the other person and be there for them when it was their time to die. In the case of my experience, I died first and, as promised, I visited him--even if I, at least, had completely forgotten about making this promise in the first place.

2055,DEE,1420,15,,M,"On the third day in the hospital, the day I had planned to end my life, I spent the only night of my treatment without a roommate. In hindsight, however, I know that I was not alone that evening. During a period of intense reflection, I decided to open the Bible that was provided in each room. I casually flipped through the pages and eventually turned to the back cover where someone had scribbled a few of their favorite verses, one of which was Ecclesiastes 7:17. I immediately located chapter 7 / verse 17 in the very top right corner of the page, next to the page number of 717, where the number 717 was scratched in pen directly above the page number. I was strangely comforted and terrified simultaneously as I read the words, \xe2\x80\x9cBe not over much wicked; neither be thou foolish. Why shouldest thou die before thy time.\xe2\x80\x9d The rest of the chapter proceeds to advise the reader against submitting to the extremes of both righteousness and wickness, foolishness and wisdom, and purity and profane. Ill always have a physical monument of this miraculous affirmation of Gods love for me because, like the heathen I am, I took advantage of my lone solitary evening in the hospitial to secretly remove the passage which I carry on my person to this day.  Though I did not realize it until ten years after the fact, this was a covenent with God that was initiated before I ever even entered the hospital. Shortly before I plotted my suicide and entered the hospital, I had carved a cross into my chest and filled it with black ink as I selfishly pleaded with God to end my girlfriends unintended pregnancy. At the age of fifteen, my shortsighted naivity deluded my judgment into thinking this child would mark the end of my existence. Shortly thereafter, my girlfriend miscarried an innocent life whose destiny was not its own. I had desperately pleaded with God to change the course of my life and received more than I bargained for when, to my surprise, our covenent was sealed during that third evening in that hospital. The undoubted reason that God used the trifect appearance of 717 to get my attention is because 717 indicates the month and day of my birth on July 17, 1987. It was through this miracle that God sealed our first covenant with the symbol of 717. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a wealth of revelations that have continued to unfold through the present day.

2060,ME ,1068,21,,M,"This STE described below may seem mundane in comparison to several others Ive had in previous and later years. In my previous STEs I wasnt able to process the experiences correctly or truly appreciate their significance. However, I consider the experience Im about the share to be the most important. It has ultimately lead me to receive answers to many questions that I had accumulated in my life, up to that point. It has also lead me to a comforting state of existence. The most simplistic way I can describe the experiences is: the light was switched on, like flipping a switch for a light bulb. I had been so confused and full of important questions. Questions that my brain couldnt fathom at the time. These important questions now seemed to have attainable answers after the light was switched on. I was sitting, watching the movie in the theater. Literally, out of nowhere, my thought process evolved. it not only distressed me, but delighted me. I left the movie theater immediately, with my girlfriend. She was hysterical and upset that I couldnt give words to my emotions. I was to overwhelmed with emotion to accurately portray correct explanations. I was literally in tears the whole ride back to my parent house, about 15 miles away. I was finally able to mutter the words, I cant really describe this, I just feel a better connection with GOD!!. Immediately after I uttered those words, IMMEDIATELY, a beautiful white owl swooped in front of my car at 65MPH. Its a miracle in itself, that the owl wasnt smashed. This was instant reassurance that my feelings were profound. We stared at each other, mouths aghast. She, being a very stubborn religious person, instantly grasped my feelings. She said, wow, I understand now. When we arrived at my parents house, we discussed in depth, the implications. Neither of us really had the thought process, or capability, to understand the importance. After evolving spiritually, mentally, and emotionally, we both concur that this experience was a turning point in our cognitive evolution. The majestic quality and timing of the sighting was overwhelming. Three years earlier, my grandfather Robert Heinemann, had died. his dying, or re-birthing process, greatly affected my father and I. My grandfather was on kidney dialysis at the time. The burden on my grandmother, and his body, eventually became too much. The family decided to take him off dialysis and let him pass. I had visited him a few days before he died. He was in and out of earthly consciousness, conversing with dead friends, family members, and old acquaintances. I received the news he had died right before a high school, playoff, soccer match. I felt my grandfather during the game. I didnt feel him beside me, I felt him within me. The entire game I heard the words he had uttered to me before every game that he watched. He would say work as hard as you can and everything will pay off. This was always in the back of my head while playing games. But, this time it was different. The advice was not only in the front of my head, but had become tattooed into my soul. I played the game like a man possessed. I scored a pivotal, game tying goal. I also scored the game winning penalty kick. Walking up to the ball, before the game winning kick, was different. Spectators said the Washington rain halted. I thought of nothing. my mind was clear, pure, and focused. I wasnt thinking about my grandfathers re-birthing or losing the game. I didnt even feel my body until the ball hit the net. I then felt an overwhelming amount of joy. I knew that Grandpa Bob was within me on a spiritual level. It was amazing. In the days after this experience, I wanted to discover more. I believed in spirit, and the beyond, up until this point, but had never experienced it like this. This was personal and moving, to the point where I could barely comprehend the emotion. I thought more about the conversations he had with passed souls in the hospital. I thought more about his love and spirit within me. I thought about things that held little meaning to me, prior to his death. For three years I had put the experience in my vault. I somehow knew that I wasnt ready to fully face the answers for the questions I had. One thing did comfort me before the STEs mentioned above. I always had random run-ins with beautiful birds. The run-ins always occurred when my brain was calm and relaxed, in a meditative and comforting state. my first encounter was during our first annual family golf tournament. We decided to honor Grandpa Bob by hosting a golf event. Before my round started, we were warming up on the range. It was a beautiful Washington summer morning, very tranquil.

2062,OBE,1521,43,,F,"I had a two part experience with this series. I had an OBE with the first and fourth meditation. In the first meditation I experienced a dropping down into my heart. Once that happened, I felt myself leave my physical body. I found myself in the rings of Saturn. I observed this area for a bit. I could feel something like wind and could hear the planet rotating. I watched as rocky material went by. I say watched, but it wasnt like watching with your eyes. I felt like I was going in a circular motion and felt like I was standing, but not really standing. I shifted my consciousness to look down because I felt like I had moved from the rings to somewhere else. I found my consciousness in the middle of the DNA helix. It seems like I stayed there for quite awhile and could feel a sense of awe. I felt in awe throughout this whole experience. I then found myself sort of floating in what felt and looked like darkness, but not scary darkness more like space darkness. I became aware of a shape, but it was on a mammoth scale. There is nothing that I can even compare it to. It felt like God, OM, greatness. I was then in the middle of what seemed like what would be comparable to the bloodstream. I was moving very fast and saw lots of red around me. This shifted from the bloodstream to the galaxies, other planets, humans, animals, trees, everything. I felt like I was being shown that everything is connected and on an even larger scale, we make (everything) actually makes up God/OM. We are the heart, everything is about the heart. In the 4th mediation I had a similar, but different experience. I dropped down into my heart again, but I stayed there for a bit. I had the sensation that I was laying on my left side. I could hear a muffled heart beat. Not a perfect beat and it sounded as if it may even be skipping beats, but so comforting. I became aware of the feeling of warm fluid all around me and inside my nose, lungs, mouth. I could see my right hand, but it was very tiny and very pink. It was mostly dark, but a little bit of white light was around the edges of this space. I felt as if this was me and I was in my mothers womb. I remember feeling the most comforted I ever have. It was so comforting, but also very confining, but not in a bad way. From there, I felt like I was in a white light spiral. The spiral shot the purest white light through my heart and out of the crown of my head-simultaneously. My consciousness catapulted out of my chest, but also through my head. Up, straight up and fast, but completely enveloped with white light and love. I felt like there were beings that were moving with me, supporting me, but they had no physical characteristics.

I put the coffee pot on the stove, grabbed a quick shower, put on a sweatshirt, poured myself a cup of coffee, and sat down to read a couple chapters from an Eric Von Daniken book I had just picked up the day before. A couple hours later, I put on a rainproof windbreaker and headed for town. When I arrived at Charlies Lounge, Jim was already there. Whats the special?, I asked the bartender.  Burger and fries, he said. Good enough for me, I replied. Put some cheese on it too. Jim looked over and smiled. You wanna beer? Ah, its a little early for that I said. Come on, one with lunch wont hurt you. he said. Get him a draught, he said to the bartender. Jim was a road construction worker who hadnt been working for the past couple weeks due to the incessant rain. Id known him since we were kids. His boredom wasnt as intense as mine, but the cold, dreary rain was getting a lot of people down in this tiny Pennsylvania railroad town. It was a tough little town along the edge of the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania. The heart of Appalachia was just a few minutes away. The Vietnam War was just winding down and Watergate was front page news every day. Life, like the weather, was bleak. A month earlier I had finished a two year stint as a Military Policeman in Germany.  I was accustomed to the excitement of constant stimulation. As a policeman I had weathered the drama and tragedy of the Munich Olympics, witnessed first hand the violence of the militant Baader-Meinhof Gang, and while wearing the white hat of law enforcement, had been front and center in the unpredictable and dangerous world of heroin addiction. Okay, Ill sip on a beer, I said to the bartender. Jim smiled. When I looked in his direction I could see a couple guys playing a game of pool. Immediately my radar went off. Two brothers were playing a game of eightball. One of the brothers was a year older than me, and had been a superb football player. The other brother was a year younger than me and had always been a bit of a troublemaker. And, he was drunk! It just past noon and he was drunker than a skunk. Several years earlier, I had been in an all out fight with the younger one. I had knocked him down and was on top of him, pounding the living daylights out of him when someone pulled me off.  Here he was again. Drunk, and this time with his older brother, who it appeared he was going to try and impress. He was staring at me. His face was getting red. I could feel my adrenalin surging. Every drop of testosterone in my body was lit up. The two years in the military had added 30 pounds of muscle to my body. I had been trained in judo and self defense techniques. I was capable of putting anyone into submission in seconds. I was ready! To avoid initiating any confrontation and to maintain my focus, I chose to gaze at the cue ball(the all white pool ball) as it bounded around the pool table. A moment went by, then two. I kept my focus on the cue ball. I began developing a slightly different mind set. I clearly remembering saying to myself, I choose to not allow my emotions to dictate my actions. I choose to just stay focused on the neutral cue ball. Then BOOM, it happened. Suddenly, without warning, my entire state of consciousness shot directly out of the top of my head. Everything I knew to be me was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and accelerating by the second. At first I seemed to have shot through a tunnel like zone, then into a brightly lit world. I went past cities, land masses, continents, entire worlds. and universes. I clearly remember seeing a great River. I remember thinking at the time that it must be the River that St John spoke of in Revelations. I remember clearly because, at the time, I was a dyed in the wool atheist. But I didnt stop there.

2064,NDE,1093,29,,F,"The next thing I became aware of after being in the hallway was seeing my body below me. I was lying on a table, my lower half covered in blue draping. There was a doctor handing someting to a person at my right shoulder who took it and quickly and turned her back to me. I saw her arms moving very quickly, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what she was doing. There was blood all over my abdomen. Another doctor was threading something into my chest, he was at my left side. Someone else came into the room to my right.  I was \xe2\x80\x9cfloating\xe2\x80\x9d past the ceiling. I was aware of this detail and found it interesting. I was \xe2\x80\x9cKrista\xe2\x80\x9d but not attached to the body below or the events going on in the room. I was simply an observer. I wanted to keep watching but was pulled to my left by a very strong force. I resisted only for an instant, then knew I must go. It was almost as if I was \xe2\x80\x9csucked\xe2\x80\x9d into this tunnel-like space. There were no defining \xe2\x80\x9cwalls\xe2\x80\x9d, only a static-like grey/white/black type of atmosphere throughout. I was a part of this static. I was moving at lightening speed. There was no time, and I remained Krista throughout the entire event. In the tunnel I next felt the bliss of all-penetrating, all encompassing love. No words can describe this feeling. I was \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d. All the questions I\xe2\x80\x99d ever had in my life were answered in an instant. The confirmation I was given was that we are here to love one another. Period. We are here to love. The next thing that happened was I was emerging from the static to a light grey illumination that was sort of milky cloudy in substance. There were beings lined up to my left, waiting for me to arrive. I did not know any of these beings. There was a young boy, around 12, who wore a round brimmed hat, like a child would have in the 1800\xe2\x80\x99s. For an instant I wanted to be there, then I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I was back in the tunnel very briefly when it opened up to this vast, indescribably beautiful landscape. Breathtaking. I was immensely joyful and so very loved by it and everything. There were bright yellow flowers spread out across the ground in front of me. A forest lay to the right. A rock waterfall surrounded in lush greenery to the left. Past the flowers were undulating green grass hills dotted with trees and a bright blue sky above. It was Eden. It was home. In an instant I was given the choice to leave and I did. I knew I needed to be back here and be a mother. My next memory was of being in the ICU.

2065,DEE,1295,5,,F,"I was about 5 years old. I was going through emotional trauma because my parents were divorcing and my beloved father had suddenly, without warning to me, and permanently left our home, leaving me to fend for myself with my withdrawn, unaffectionate mother and my older sister who hated me. One day I was leaving our 6th floor apartment to visit a friendly neighbor. I opened the front door but I stood on the threshold and couldnt go any further. I looked down the long dark hallway but I couldnt take a step off the threshold and out onto the hallway floor. Even though I walked down this dark hallway many, many times before, on that day I couldnt move. I was physically paralyzed. I tried to turn around to go back into my house but I just stood there unable to move. I couldnt move in any direction. My mind wanted to move but I couldnt get my body to move. Then a strange thing happened. I saw an ethereal mist surround me in the shape of a cocoon and it began to wrap itself around me, starting at my feet, going up and stopping at my neck. My whole body, including my arms, was wrapped in this mummy-like cocoon. It made me feel safe, protected and warm. It calmed me down. Then I got an idea how to break out of the paralysis. I suddenly put out my arms and began to twirl off the threshold. I twirled and twirled all the way down the long hallway. I remember my twirling became a habit because I was twirling in my home, in the hallways and in the streets. I thought I was dancing. I think that people thought I was dancing. I feel that Holy Spirit came to me on that day to protect me and to help me.

2069,DEE,1046,35,,M,"few weeks ago I had a powerful experience. I wouldnt call it a dream. I needed to write it down so I can remember the full intensity of the experience. Also to be able to reflect upon it, both now and in the future.        It has taken me sometime to get it all down; I have laboured to get every moment, every feeling, every thought that I had during it down on these pages- there was a lot to it. Its taken upwards of three weeks to get it all down completely. The experience started with a prayer to God I made the night previous. The prayer was; To show me a path out of my dilemma, and to show me how I got to be where I am now. I went to sleep that night and then I found myself in a familiar room from my past. I found myself in a spectacular room packed with Christmas presents, Christmas ornaments, and a Christmas tree. All unique in the fact that they were all composed of the same colours; black and silver. It was beautiful. It was breathtaking. It was simply astounding to be in the room.        I have a memory of being in that room, long, long ago, possibly even prior to my birth into this world. I remember being in the room and playing with many other children there, all of whom were equally astounded to be there. After playing for a while in this room the adults there began to give away Christmas presents to all of the children. I received my FIRST Christmas present there. I watched, as the other children opened their boxes and they received all kinds of toys, exquisite clothing and other gifts that were extraordinary to be sure, but I chose to wait till the end of the presentations to get my box towards the last. At my turn to receive a gift, what I found inside my box was a small floating glowing crystal.  The adults there asked me if I wanted it. I remember looking at it with intense curiosity. It shone brightly in silver, and then would fade to black- but even then when it was completely black, you could still discern that it was a beautiful crystal. Then after awhile it would lighten, it would become black for a while and then it would become somewhat silver, and then fade back some then again silver and then again black. Sometimes completely black and sometimes brightly silver. Some of the other children had received this type of crystal, as well, in their first Christmas presents. All of the crystals were similar, but each shone and faded at different intervals and for different periods of time. I examined some of the other lucky childrens crystals, some shone brightly silver most of the time, others would shine and then fade at regular intervals, others were erratic- shining and fading at seemingly random intervals. All were beautiful and all looked extremely fragile. All of the other kids who had not received a crystal were jealous of what the lucky children had received. It was like they had not passed some type of a test of character and they were not yet ready for this type of a gift. Again, the adults there in the room with me expressed some doubt, and asked me if I wanted my present? Again I looked and compared my crystal with what the other lucky children had, my crystal with this second look seemed somehow defective. My crystal had long periods where it would be completely dark, several periods where it would be between dark and light, and very short periods where it would shine brighter than any of the other crystals. Then it occurred to me that this wasnt a defective crystal at all, but in fact, a unique crystal that was completely different from any of the others that I had seen. I said yes- I wanted my present, and this present, this present of this oddly glowing and fading crystal was actually the gift of a life in this world. I got my life out of it. The other lucky children got their lives out of their crystals as well, each life different from the next.        This time, now, that I was in the room, everything was the same except there were no other children here. I was equally astounded to be in this meticulously decorated room and yet, I had a sense that I didnt want any of it. That it was just a memory from long ago, and that having matured to middle age- I didnt want any of it anymore. It was like the passing of a stage. How many of the other children had settled for the shiny wrappers and the electric thrills, ornamental clothing and toys, and I, like a few other lucky ones, had waited till the last and received the most precious gift of all- a life, and now I didnt want mine anymore!  And from here I felt I had passed a stage into another room up above the room I had been in. I was lifted up on a strange device that swung me back and forth, gradually upwards towards this other room further up above. This next room was an empty schoolroom, barren and empty except for a freshly shiny-waxed floor and a man in what appeared to be a secu",,Canadian,"251,00",agnostic,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,very strong,moder,"25,000 49",some,Truck d,,marri,marri,Yes,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult
2070,ME ,1287,57,,F,"On January 12, 2002 something pivotal happened that enabled me to open my mind to believe in God. My husband Hank and I were staying at a historic, antique-filled bed and breakfast, Butternut Farm, in Glastonbury, Connecticut. (I dont think the owners of this establishment would want it to be made public that their bed and breakfast is haunted.) It was Saturday night and we went to sleep on the comfortable and luxurious bed. In the middle of the night, I woke up, eyes wide open, and sat up tall in bed. Looking back on this experience, I must have looked like I was in one of those movies when someone is under a spell and rises from their sleep with their eyes wide open, back straight as a board. I didnt hear or smell anything and I wasnt touched by anything but I instantly turned my head to the left and saw something. About three feet away from me, suspended in mid air about eye level to me, was a ghost. The ghost was shaped like a huge, round, horizontal Bayer aspirin tablet. It was flat on the top and bottom with rounded edges. It was about two feet in diameter. The ghost was made up of thousands of tiny black particles, each shaped like a sperm, which furiously rotated clockwise as fast as a tornado. It spun around so violently that it spewed off some of the tiny black particles. But, although the ghost was just a couple of feet away and although it was spinning as fast as a tornado, I didnt feel a breeze and none of the particles touched me. It was as if the ghost was contained in its own little world, separate from my human world. This whole experience actually lasted just a few seconds, because as soon as I sat up and turned my head and my eyes saw the ghost, as if it saw me looking at it, it instantly broke down into an amoebic mob of black particles and made a mad dash for the closed old door and disappeared through the long crack of the warped frame. I sat up for a while thinking about this experience. Strangely, I did not feel fear because if I did, I would have awakened my husband. I did feel a sort of fear because I didnt want to put my head back down on the pillow, afraid to go back to sleep, afraid the ghost would return. But I was very tired and layed back down to ponder what I should do. The next thing I knew, it was morning. As soon as we woke up, I told Hank about the ghost. He just listened to me. He looked like he was believing me. I told him there probably was a small chance it was all a dream but I didnt think so. It didnt feel like a dream. It felt real and I remembered it in vivid detail. When we went downstairs for breakfast, I was so excited that I told everyone in the dining room what happened to me that night. The two owners mockingly pooh-poohed my story but there was a visiting pastor from Pennsylvania. She also stayed overnight because she was to give a sermon at a nearby church. She confirmed that she was also visited by the ghost. She said she didnt see what I saw but she woke up during the night and felt its presence sitting in a chair by her bed. She said that in her line of work, people often came to her with stories and issues concerning ghosts and spirits. With the pastor as witness, I was validated 100% that I did indeed see a ghost. Actually, I think this pastor was an Angel because in the days ahead I tried to reach her but I couldnt find her anywhere, even though she gave me her business card. It was as if she disappeared. Seeing the ghost was a shocking but crucial experience. It had served a greater purpose in my life than just to amaze me. It took about a year for me to digest and process the ghost before I could tell anyone else. Then I told a friend. After getting this experience out, I started to really think about the ghost. It suddenly dawned on me that I saw a ghost! The reality of seeing a ghost, I realized, became proof that there really was a spiritual world. Standing now on the threshold of this whole new world, my mind looked out and wondered: Wow! Now that I know there really is a spiritual world and that ghosts are real, what else can I believe in? The answer came in my very next breath: God. But, still, I didnt find God for another year. And on that day, everything became crystal clear.

2083,ADC,1364,25,,F,"I sat on the edge of the bed as Shawn tried to comfort me, my crying seemed to intensify with the downpour of the rain. I looked up at the ceiling in our bedroom asking God for a sign. I asked him as a Catholic, saying out loud: I have faith and I know they say he is in a better place, but I need MORE! I need PROOF that he is OKAY! And just as I shouted this at God a sudden loud bang and flash of white light filled the bedroom. Shawn and I physically jumped out of bed because the crash was so loud we thought the window was going to crash in on us. We looked at each other, puzzled. Was that for us? Because the timing was just as if God was answering my prayer. Just as that happened we began to calm down and the rain also subsided. I told Shawn that it felt like an answer from God and it was so strange. The next morning Shawn went out to our car that was parked on the street. He heard muffled music playing that grew louder as he got nearer. When he opened the car door the radio was blasting music very loud on my brothers favourite radio station. When Shawn tried to shut the radio off, it would not turn off, he had to pull the system out of its dock to make it turn off. The radio remained like that for years. The wires were fried because that night our building and our car was hit by lightening, the very lightening that crashed outside our window at the very moment I asked God for a sign / for proof that John was okay. That isnt the end of it. From then on it was like the floodgates had opened. I got all kinds of signs from John, all kinds of instances of after-death communication, including a full apparition, physical phenomenon, electronic phenomenon and I would like to share that all here. I could write my own book about all the signs John gave me and my family after his death.

As soon as I arrived and handed my father the story, I felt that same strange feeling in my heart like I had felt a year earlier--the feeling that compelled me to pray. Not wishing a repeat of what happened a year earlier (see my other DEE entry)--I excused myself, telling my father I would wait in the back lounge while he read. My father wasnt spiritual or religious, and I was embarrassed that I suddenly felt a strange urge to pray. I entered the back lounge, and shut the door. I then got down on my knees and bowed y head to the floor for the first time in my life. And I suddenly started to weep. Like, uncontrollably sob. And words came out of my mouth that werent words from conscious intention. I was baffled to hear myself speaking the words. Why are we so bad? Why are we so bad? You have to understand,I didnt have a bad bone in my body. I was kind, and sensitive, and yet, these words were flowing from my mouth. And I felt such deep deep shame. Moments later, however, I felt a hand press down on the small of my back. I tried to left my head up to see who was there, but like my hands suck together in the previous DEE, this time my whole body was stuck to the floor. Quite literally, I was pinned there and couldnt move. Before I had a chance to be afraid, however, I suddenly felt two firm hands grasp my head, lift it off the floor, and turn it to the right. And there, beside me, was a fully manifested Celestial Being, kneeling on the floor beside me and looking compassionately into my eyes. As I previously wrote, my family wasnt religious, and I had no knowledge of religion at all. However, I immediately knew this Celestial Being was Jesus like I had known him my whole life. He was bearded, and wearing simple robes. (I no longer remember the color of the robes or the color of his eyes--I was too astonished that he was there in the room with me.) His eyes were mesmerizing--I was literally transfixed by his gaze. Where I had been sobbing moments earlier, and feeling deep shame, I suddenly felt the most incredible all-encompassing feeling of unconditional love. I wasnt scared. I was in bliss. And there wasnt anything I needed to ask. I felt as if I knew everything, as if I was everything, as if I was the Love itself. And a message was transmitted to me with this Love. You are loved. You are forgiven. You are respected. You are accepted. You are special and you are important. You are cared for, and everything is perfect. All of this transpired in a matter of seconds, and then Jesus bowed his head to the floor and prayed. And the hands that had moved my head to see Jesus, turned my head back to the floor, and continued to hold me there. The next thing I remember, my father opened the door and asked me if I was okay. No, I said. Im pinned to the floor. Please call Mom. While my father went back to the front office (there was no phone in the lounge), my experience suddenly changed dramatically. I was suddenly hearing sounds that were loud and clear and very real, but very distressing. The sounds were of emergency sirens, gunfire, and women shrieking in terror. At the same time, in my minds eye, I could see the major urban intersection near my fathers office with windows all blown out, burned out shells of cars in the street, and snipers scurrying in the shadows. I thought I was being shown a vision of the end of the world, but when I asked if that is what this was, there were no answers. Moments later, my father returned, and I found that I was able to get up off the floor. My mother was on the phone and wanted to speak with me, so I headed to the front office. However, as soon as I walked into the office and saw the large picture windows, I was immediately stricken with the most intense paranoia. I collapsed to the floor, certain that I was going to get shot by a sniper (probably connected to the frightening vision I had moments earlier). Long story not as long, this paranoia lasted another half hour or so during which time my father managed to get me into his car and drive me to his house (my old family house where the previously reported DEE took place). Once I got home, and was under the care of my mother, the paranoia dissipated. However, it transformed into a mania that lasted for another 40 hours or so, during which time I believed I knew everything about everything, wrote many things about God and life, and couldnt sleep. Finally, after about 40 hours, I crashed and slept for 16 hours.

2089,NDE,1078,25,,M,"After the mask was placed on my face, the doctor told me to count backwards from 10. I began to count. When I got to 1, I realized I couldnt breathe. I also could not speak or move...or open my eyes.  I began to panic inside. I thought..Im going to die!  Immediately I started to try and think of something that would help me stay alive. Trapped inside my body and unable to move or speak, there werent many options. I thought that if I could just hold onto a thought with my mind, I would not die. So, I thought of a tree. I pictured a tree in my mind, imagined how it felt to be next to a tree, and kept repeating the word tree over and over.  I began to feel like I was moving through a dark tunnel. I felt afraid...and clung to my inner tree life rope as I moved along the dark passageway.  I moved through a darkness...murkiness... that included spirit like beings roaming around making some sounds... I did not recognize any of them...they were misty, grey entities floating around. I felt fear. I realized I could no longer see the word for tree in my mind...but I could still see the tree, and feel its presence.  I continued to move through the darkness and the spirits were gone. The tunnel was lighter. I had an instant awareness of my whole life...like a 360 degree view of everything about my life. It was extremely expansive knowing and deep knowledge. I no longer felt afraid. And I could no longer see the tree in my mind, but I could feel its presence. I was aware that there was a place I had traveled from...and I had family there... but I was not worried because I also knew that in the scheme of all I suddenly knew...all I was remembering had been just a flicker of time...my whole life had happened in less than a snap of my finger.  The light in the tunnel grew brighter and closer. I was travelling fast. Suddenly I burst though into a sea of Light...only Light.... I no longer felt the presence of the tree, because I realized I am the tree! I am everything! This was not a thought...but a knowing. An all expansive knowing.  The feeling was completely ecstatic...like an orgasm without a body. No body to limit the deep and ongoing BLISS. There were no words... just knowing. The knowing was The only thing that matters is Love... all Love It was timeless and so pure. The direct experience of Divine Love Then I became aware of something forming... like a vibration. I realized it was a thought coming into form... and the thought was: What about my son? (I had a 5 month old son at home) As soon as the vibration became a thought, I immediately began travelling back through the tunnel... fast!  I woke up in the recovery room.  I didnt tell anyone for 5 years....not even my husband.  The experience has profoundly changed my life... The experience memory has never faded...it is still more real than real.

2095,ME ,1284,36,,F,"Synchronicity \xe2\x80\x93 This is my calling\xe2\x80\xa6Why the mental health system is antiquated, and why we need to stop pretending we\xe2\x80\x99re robots in a naturally spiritual world. After years of searching for my life purpose it was handed to me on a plate, quite literally from the Universe straight into my head, like a light bulb suddenly being switched on in a deep dark cave of confusion. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t lose me here, you may be thinking: \xe2\x80\x98so who are you and what do you know about re-evaluating the conceptual framework around mental illness or achieving universal peace?\xe2\x80\x99 That is exactly what I thought when the information came to me; I am no Professor or academic guru. That is the point, this has nothing to do with who I am, I have been given this message to prove that anybody of any intellect or social standing can tap into the psychic realm and see a universal truth; all you have to do is ask the question and then believe in the answer.  I have been told by spirit that the mental health system in our Western society desperately needs modifying in terms of spiritual experience. Mental distress is actually a fallacy of modern society which is ever increasing in line with consumerism and will continue to do so unless we acknowledge the problems we are creating. We must see mental distress of any kind with new eyes if human evolution is going to continue in the way it is meant. Mental distress originates in fear, a fear lodged in our past that we carry with us into the present, and project into the future, a destructive fear from which we can be free, individually, and so, universally. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s the irony:My fear of speaking out about this message and how it came to me \xe2\x80\x93 the message that it is fear that stops mankind achieving mental wellbeing, happiness and fundamentally Universal peace \xe2\x80\x93 nearly stopped me from following my path, after years of searching! I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that I\xe2\x80\x99m not still scared, but what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were to tell everyone they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be scared, if I were too afraid to put my head above the parapet and risk being shot at? Before I had my \xe2\x80\x98experience\xe2\x80\x99 I knew nothing about spirituality, and even less about religion. So what happened was as incredulous to me as what you are going to read may sound to you! I have, however, always had good intuition and a kind of underlying \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 since childhood that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching for something that was missing, like I always knew there was another dimension even though society and my education told me otherwise. I was about 12 when I read the book \xe2\x80\x98Utopia\xe2\x80\x99 and to me it was more than just fiction, it was a possibility. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t just think it\xe2\x80\x99s achievable; I know how. It all happened when I had started to meditate at the same time as thinking more deeply about what to be \xe2\x80\x98mentally ill\xe2\x80\x99 actually means. I\xe2\x80\x99d worked within the field for long enough to know about academic theory; the nature / nurture argument and chemical imbalances. What was the truth? I started to question my own sanity, I have always been very sensitive and emotional; where do you draw the line? I am well aware that by writing this, that by voicing my beliefs that I have channelled a message from the spiritual realm, I could be seen by some working within the mental health field as being deluded or having experienced a psychotic episode. You may choose to believe that this is the rambling of an unstable mind, you may suggest that what I am saying is insane. I, however, now know that the real insanity would be for me to ignore such an important message. If I were to ignore it and deny myself my truth for fear of speaking out against a system, I know that I would become mentally distressed \xe2\x80\x93 and that is also proof enough for me to know that the message I have been given is the truth. Many people who try to speak out about their psychic experiences are told that what they are experiencing is not real; that they are \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99. So either way, if somebody has a spiritual experience they are more than likely doomed to some form of mental distress, predominantly not from the experience itself, but from either repressing it due to fear, or from believing they are going \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99 if they do dare to speak out because they are told that what is happening to them isn\xe2\x80\x99t real. The message I was given confirmed all of this. So I had been contemplating the true nature of mental illness, and whether indeed I was mentally unwell, and my brain went into overload so I decided I needed to try to relax.

2098,ME ,1068,21,,M,"This STE described below may seem mundane in comparison to several others Ive had in previous and later years. In my previous STEs I wasnt able to process the experiences correctly or truly appreciate their significance. However, I consider the experience Im about the share to be the most important. It has ultimately lead me to receive answers to many questions that I had accumulated in my life, up to that point. It has also lead me to a comforting state of existence. The most simplistic way I can describe the experiences is: the light was switched on, like flipping a switch for a light bulb. I had been so confused and full of important questions. Questions that my brain couldnt fathom at the time. These important questions now seemed to have attainable answers after the light was switched on. I was sitting, watching the movie in the theater. Literally, out of nowhere, my thought process evolved. it not only distressed me, but delighted me. I left the movie theater immediately, with my girlfriend. She was hysterical and upset that I couldnt give words to my emotions. I was to overwhelmed with emotion to accurately portray correct explanations. I was literally in tears the whole ride back to my parent house, about 15 miles away. I was finally able to mutter the words, I cant really describe this, I just feel a better connection with GOD!!. Immediately after I uttered those words, IMMEDIATELY, a beautiful white owl swooped in front of my car at 65MPH. Its a miracle in itself, that the owl wasnt smashed. This was instant reassurance that my feelings were profound. We stared at each other, mouths aghast. She, being a very stubborn religious person, instantly grasped my feelings. She said, wow, I understand now. When we arrived at my parents house, we discussed in depth, the implications. Neither of us really had the thought process, or capability, to understand the importance. After evolving spiritually, mentally, and emotionally, we both concur that this experience was a turning point in our cognitive evolution. The majestic quality and timing of the sighting was overwhelming. Three years earlier, my grandfather Robert Heinemann, had died. his dying, or re-birthing process, greatly affected my father and I. My grandfather was on kidney dialysis at the time. The burden on my grandmother, and his body, eventually became too much. The family decided to take him off dialysis and let him pass. I had visited him a few days before he died. He was in and out of earthly consciousness, conversing with dead friends, family members, and old acquaintances. I received the news he had died right before a high school, playoff, soccer match. I felt my grandfather during the game. I didnt feel him beside me, I felt him within me. The entire game I heard the words he had uttered to me before every game that he watched. He would say work as hard as you can and everything will pay off. This was always in the back of my head while playing games. But, this time it was different. The advice was not only in the front of my head, but had become tattooed into my soul. I played the game like a man possessed. I scored a pivotal, game tying goal. I also scored the game winning penalty kick. Walking up to the ball, before the game winning kick, was different. Spectators said the Washington rain halted. I thought of nothing. my mind was clear, pure, and focused. I wasnt thinking about my grandfathers re-birthing or losing the game. I didnt even feel my body until the ball hit the net. I then felt an overwhelming amount of joy. I knew that Grandpa Bob was within me on a spiritual level. It was amazing. In the days after this experience, I wanted to discover more. I believed in spirit, and the beyond, up until this point, but had never experienced it like this. This was personal and moving, to the point where I could barely comprehend the emotion. I thought more about the conversations he had with passed souls in the hospital. I thought more about his love and spirit within me. I thought about things that held little meaning to me, prior to his death. For three years I had put the experience in my vault. I somehow knew that I wasnt ready to fully face the answers for the questions I had. One thing did comfort me before the STEs mentioned above. I always had random run-ins with beautiful birds. The run-ins always occurred when my brain was calm and relaxed, in a meditative and comforting state. my first encounter was during our first annual family golf tournament. We decided to honor Grandpa Bob by hosting a golf event. Before my round started, we were warming up on the range. It was a beautiful Washington summer morning, very tranquil.

2114,ME ,1489,56,,M," By about nine p.m. I noticed that I was hearing songs in a way I never had before. I seemed to be entering more deeply than usual into the mind of the writer and understanding what was being emotionally conveyed. So I kept listening. I felt the sorrows and joys of others as they spoke to me in song. I felt the tragic beauty in the passions, lost hopes and brevity of life as experienced by other people. There was a collision of sadness and beauty, a kind of majestic sorrow. I wondered if it was due to being fifty six years of age and being able to relate to many situations in life. Shivers repeatedly rose in waves up my spine from its base. I could not recall ever enjoying music to such an extent. I identified so closely with the singers, I became them. I could get up and go to the bathroom or get a drink of chilled water from the kitchen without losing the spinal effect. I then returned to the headphones and Yahoo Radio on the computer. The shivers of pleasure continued to rise in waves up my spine and began to intensify and surge down my legs and up my arms. The base of my head, at the rear, where the spine joins the skull was hit by waves of exquisite sensation with each new song. It felt like a hand was gripping the upper back of my neck where it meets the skull, and channelling in high voltage pleasure direct to my brain. After each wave of energy up my spine, this sensation did not totally subside, but seemed to remain as a scintillation of increased magnitude higher than the level before it. I became concerned as the euphoric physical effects intensified and extended in duration. I checked my pulse by the clock to see if I had an elevated heart rate associated with panic attacks. My pulse was normal and steady and my body felt very, very relaxed. I had the sensation of settling or falling back, deeper within my body, as the experience continued. My mind was paradoxically calm, intensely present, sharply aware and my cognition totally functioning and nimble. The waves of sensation up my spine became a volcanic rush that entered my head. I was thinking \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Oh, Oh! Awesome! Go with it!\xe2\x80\x9d Rivers of energy flowed outwards along my limbs. By now it was after midnight. My body felt almost weightless. I felt immense power flowing through my body. At one point I looked at my hands and they felt so full of the sensation of energy and so insubstantial that I wondered if they might pass through the wall if I tried. I touched the wall out of curiosity and my hand was certainly still solid as it touched the wall! It was just that I could not feel my hand. It went on and on, hour after hour as powerful waves of surging energy, ever intensifying. I was totally immersed in intense ecstasy. Suddenly, there was another huge rush of energy upwards. There was complete darkness. I found my locus of consciousness now resting in the centre of my head as a tiny pin point. The room I was sitting in had totally disappeared from sight. It was dark and comforting in the centre of my brain. Then, there was a final atomic eruption I could feel rising beneath this tiny \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d, my centre of total awareness, and it burst forth from the top of my head carrying that tiny point in a massive torrent of energy that felt like a clear, cool viscous liquid, and my awareness emerged into a infinite yet intimate space which was like an endless ocean where I felt connected to all things in the cosmos. I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! I must have died! Oh well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d I had no fear. I was merely a point of consciousness with no body at all. I was overcome with immense gratitude for the privilege of having been alive, and for my life with its joys as well as its sorrows and the total improbability of just being. I thanked God.  Following on was an instantaneous, total life review. It was like viewing a three hundred and sixty degree panoramic picture screen with all of my life events played out simultaneously. Many of the things I had thought very significant in my life were not at all important. My preconceptions of right and wrong melted away. I did not feel judged in any way, I felt completely accepted. Everything was meaningful in my life and nothing I had experienced was wasted. The only things that now mattered in my past life were the times I had shown loving compassion to other people and living things. Then I felt enormous, limitless, feelings of joy, love, compassion and empathy for humankind and all living things. I felt intimate kinship with all humanity. I somehow was The Divine Mother with a heart for all my suffering beings and wanted to encompass them in arms of love and mercy and tell them everything was all right and always had been. Everything was perfect and always had been and always would be.

2122,ME ,1451,24,,M,"Detail may take a bit more space than there is here, but I will attempt. Briefly, very tired, I fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed like the beginning of a dream sequence, I found myself on the second floor of a mansion in town that I was quite personally familiar with. From a spot in the hall, I noticed flashing lights coming from the hallway of the west wing. Irritated and needing to investigate I went in their direction. Where the halls joined at a right angle, still more lights and, of all people, my great aunt staring into the lights at the end of the hall. Very agitated at this occurence, not knowing if it was fire, or some other upset that required my attention, I began a trot in its direction. At that point I recall (kind of like Santas reindeer!) a lifting of my feet and legs and up I went. In very short order all went dark, all fell away (my body, place, circumstances)and the essential me of me was involved in an ascent...until coming to said portal mentioned earlier in which all I can recall were cloudlike formations over a cauldronlike (and that word is not to have any negative connotation) basis...with what was bubbling up from the cauldron mixing in with the clouds above it and this was perfection and creation in action. My KNOWING at that time was that I was in everything, everything was in me, and that everything was in a perfect balance. The other notion I had was that the energy was so powerful that if it were withdrawn everything would collapse, but that that would not happen...furthermore, the word calibrated came to mind. As in, everything was perfectly calibrated to hold only its allotment of that energy, and that one-zillionth more of it and a body would burst into bits. At the portals edge, even though I had no body or even much in the way of caring about what had happened to it, I do recall my hands grabbing the portals edge and I kind of docked there and went no further...only witnessed the roiling of the generator of all that is, was and would be (as described before.) At about the point of docking and peering in, I was conscious, alert, awake and aware, and said to myself: OMG, Im dying! and then something to the effect of I didnt want to do that. (That would be the distressing part and I almost clicked another choice for 42.) As soon as I said that the experience of coming down began, the up there having been short-circuited by my ambivalence or fear...even as I quick-changed my mind and said, No, NO! (leave me up here for a while longer.) The coming down was not so memorable in and of itself. What there is to know is that I did then and still do sleep on my back...and I felt as if my feet were the first to gain life back and then the descent of the rest back down as if my astral back to stomach and like that. As my arms were folded across my chest, they were the last to come to and I recall being conscious of that happening. Upon full re-entry I was quite astonished at the whole thing and lept out of bed as if every cell was on fire and said Holy S**t, Theres nothing I cant do! Later on I went at myself over that notion-thinking that it was a bit egocentric, but I digress. I further recall that everything in the room had a bit of a glow to it, and so probably did I. I also remember being fascinated at a pencil in my room. Its interiority struck me as magnificent...and to think that none of it (me, my body, material circumstances) had mattered or even existed just moments before was quite startling.

2124,ME ,1068,21,,M,"This STE described below may seem mundane in comparison to several others Ive had in previous and later years. In my previous STEs I wasnt able to process the experiences correctly or truly appreciate their significance. However, I consider the experience Im about the share to be the most important. It has ultimately lead me to receive answers to many questions that I had accumulated in my life, up to that point. It has also lead me to a comforting state of existence. The most simplistic way I can describe the experiences is: the light was switched on, like flipping a switch for a light bulb. I had been so confused and full of important questions. Questions that my brain couldnt fathom at the time. These important questions now seemed to have attainable answers after the light was switched on. I was sitting, watching the movie in the theater. Literally, out of nowhere, my thought process evolved. it not only distressed me, but delighted me. I left the movie theater immediately, with my girlfriend. She was hysterical and upset that I couldnt give words to my emotions. I was to overwhelmed with emotion to accurately portray correct explanations. I was literally in tears the whole ride back to my parent house, about 15 miles away. I was finally able to mutter the words, I cant really describe this, I just feel a better connection with GOD!!. Immediately after I uttered those words, IMMEDIATELY, a beautiful white owl swooped in front of my car at 65MPH. Its a miracle in itself, that the owl wasnt smashed. This was instant reassurance that my feelings were profound. We stared at each other, mouths aghast. She, being a very stubborn religious person, instantly grasped my feelings. She said, wow, I understand now. When we arrived at my parents house, we discussed in depth, the implications. Neither of us really had the thought process, or capability, to understand the importance. After evolving spiritually, mentally, and emotionally, we both concur that this experience was a turning point in our cognitive evolution. The majestic quality and timing of the sighting was overwhelming. Three years earlier, my grandfather Robert Heinemann, had died. his dying, or re-birthing process, greatly affected my father and I. My grandfather was on kidney dialysis at the time. The burden on my grandmother, and his body, eventually became too much. The family decided to take him off dialysis and let him pass. I had visited him a few days before he died. He was in and out of earthly consciousness, conversing with dead friends, family members, and old acquaintances. I received the news he had died right before a high school, playoff, soccer match. I felt my grandfather during the game. I didnt feel him beside me, I felt him within me. The entire game I heard the words he had uttered to me before every game that he watched. He would say work as hard as you can and everything will pay off. This was always in the back of my head while playing games. But, this time it was different. The advice was not only in the front of my head, but had become tattooed into my soul. I played the game like a man possessed. I scored a pivotal, game tying goal. I also scored the game winning penalty kick. Walking up to the ball, before the game winning kick, was different. Spectators said the Washington rain halted. I thought of nothing. my mind was clear, pure, and focused. I wasnt thinking about my grandfathers re-birthing or losing the game. I didnt even feel my body until the ball hit the net. I then felt an overwhelming amount of joy. I knew that Grandpa Bob was within me on a spiritual level. It was amazing. In the days after this experience, I wanted to discover more. I believed in spirit, and the beyond, up until this point, but had never experienced it like this. This was personal and moving, to the point where I could barely comprehend the emotion. I thought more about the conversations he had with passed souls in the hospital. I thought more about his love and spirit within me. I thought about things that held little meaning to me, prior to his death. For three years I had put the experience in my vault. I somehow knew that I wasnt ready to fully face the answers for the questions I had. One thing did comfort me before the STEs mentioned above. I always had random run-ins with beautiful birds. The run-ins always occurred when my brain was calm and relaxed, in a meditative and comforting state. my first encounter was during our first annual family golf tournament. We decided to honor Grandpa Bob by hosting a golf event. Before my round started, we were warming up on the range. It was a beautiful Washington summer morning, very tranquil. I had another clear moment, at peace with everything. I gave thanks to Bob for allowing us to experience this day and come together.

2129,ADC,1514,40,,F,"I was sleeping with my 9 year old son, Connor. My brother, Tripp, came to wake me up to tell me that my step-mother had called to tell him my father had passed away. I believe the time was 2:36 a.m. or close to that. When Tripp whispered to my from the hallway, I immediately jolted awake. I knew why he was waking me. He told me that he was going to my dads house, but that I should not go. I went downstairs to tell my husband that my dad had passed. Looking back, I was very calm. I was not crying or upset. My dad and I had an extremely close relationship. I was wide awake, so it was not that I wasnt fully understanding, I just wasnt upset for some reason. I went back upstairs and quietly got back in bed so as not to wake up my son. As soon as I lay back down, I fell back to sleep with no problem at all. (Another thing that seems strange given the situation.) It seems as soon as I feel asleep, I wasnt really sleep anymore, but sitting on my couch at my own home in Savannah. I looked up from my couch down the hall to my front door. Our front door has glass panes in it. Through the panes, I could see my dad standing there. He looked young like he did when I was a little girl. He had on seersucker pants, a starched white shirt and a bright yellow tie. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I slowly walked to the door. Time seemed to go very slowly. He was patiently waiting and just smiling at me through the glass, his eyes never leaving mine. As I made my way to the door, I knew that he shouldnt be there. I also wondered how I got from the bed at my brothers house to my house in Savannah. I knew that he was gone and should not be here on earth. As I opened the door, he smiled, and said, Hey there, Sweet Girl...I promised you I would come back to see you in Savannah. I just stood there for what seemed like a long time and then slowly walked to him and started to hug him, but then I remembered the pain it caused when I hugged him because of the tumors in his abdomen. But he sensed my hesitation, and said, It is OK Sweet Girl. You cant hurt me anymore. There is no more pain. Then he walked through the front door, into my foyer and straight up my staircase where he just kind of vanished...I stood and watched him walk away, then I just immediately woke up, and I was wide awake, and the dream was as real and vivid as if I had just been standing at my front door. I was not groggy at all or scared or sad. I was so happy and comforted that he had come to me. I could still feel our hug. I looked at the clock and less than 40 minutes had passed since my brother had come in to tell me that my dad had passed away. I lay there for over an hour replaying the dream.

2135,ME ,1431,28,,F,"It was a warm July evening in 2010. I had two 8month-old twin daughters at the time. I got an invitation for a dinner with friends and spent the evening with them. My husband was at home with the girls. I was walking home after the dinner. It was already dark and the city lights were on. I was walking on a deserted street alone when a car passed me. Young men were sitting in it, hearing loud music. I did not really pay attention to them and turned into another street, which was much darker. Suddenly a really strong invisible force hit me, and I staggered into a dark corner near a house. I almost fell, and was shocked. 2 seconds later the same car with the young men appeared in the street. This time they were driving very slowly as if they were looking for something/someone. They could not see me, as I was still in the dark corner of a house. They passed me again, this time the music was off. I realized later that they must have been looking for me. I struggled to get myself together in the corner where I was still crouching. I was shocked because it was clearly not me, who decided to hide in the corner. It was as if someone/something had hit me or shoved me there. I went home at last but I have not told anybody about this experience for a long time, not even my husband.

2139,DEE,1272,64,,F,"Hank and I vacationed every June at a resort in Lenox, Massachusetts. It was a week-long event that offered workshops to the many people who returned year after year.  For four years I gave a workshop called Conversations About God. This open forum invited people to talk about how they felt about God and about their spiritual experiences. It was not about religion, only God. We talked about the signs we received from God and about miracles we saw or heard in our personal lives. My goal for this workshop was for us to get close to God and to connect with each other. On Friday, June 26, 2009 at 1:45pm, I went to a room to conduct my workshop which was to start at 2:00. I was standing by the rooms door waiting to greet people as they arrived. A man walked up to me. He was a large man, about 62. He had white hair nicely styled...bald on top, longish on the bottom. He wore a geometric-designed tent garment that covered him from neck to knee. His face was clean-shaven with pink shiny cheeks. He had this powerful and pleasant look on his face. But I was struck by his face because it was glowing. There was an unmistakable glow coming from his face, as if a light was on inside his head. I could see that the glow was of a spiritual nature. I couldnt stop staring at his face and its glow. I asked this man if he was a minister. I was wondering if he was coming to my workshop for personal or professional reasons. He was friendly and said that he wasnt a minister but that he came for personal reasons. We chatted lightly while waiting for the rest of the people. Normally about 20-25 people came to my workshop but it was 2:00 and no one else showed up. We went inside and I set up chairs in a circle. One other man came. He was a regular participant who lived in Boston. We were friendly and teased each other because he was a Red Sox fan and I was a Yankees fan. By 2:10 I could see no one else was coming. I thought it was strange. Not even my husband Hank came that day and he came to all my other workshops. This man and I immediately locked into each other, talking. I dont really remember all that we talked about. That part of the conversation was blocked from my mind. The Boston man tried to talk with us but we totally ignored him, though not with malice, so he got up and left. The man and I continued our conversation. Then this stranger said to me, Youre an E.T. Master. I looked at him for a long while. I took him seriously, thats the strange part. Whats an E.T.? I was scared to ask this question because I kind of knew what ET meant and I was afraid to hear him say those words. He paused, staring at me, You know, an extraterrestrial. My spirit and my eyes were locked with his spirit and his eyes. Oh, I think I said. Im an Angel, he matter-of-factly said to me. I believed him. I believed everything he was telling me. I wasnt afraid of him and I didnt think he was crazy. I trusted and totally believed this total stranger. Thats whats so strange. I didnt even want to come up here, he said. I have work to do and a wife and children back home in Texas. I wasnt even planning to come to your workshop. I was sleeping but a loud noise woke me up so I looked on the agenda to see what workshops were scheduled. I saw your workshop and decided to come. Now I know I was sent here to see you. Whats your name? I asked. You can call me Fred. What work do you do? Im a CPA. What am I supposed to do? What are you saying to me? I dont understand. Are there books I should read? He looked away from me and said: You will be meeting people. They will show you the way. I dont remember what else we talked about in the one to two hours we talked. But I do remember that I was spiritually locked into him, like I was spiritually locked into the glow and cross and the ghost. He got up to leave and said goodbye. I said goodbye but I didnt get up. I couldnt get up. I was just sitting there, numb-like, just staring ahead. He stopped and turned around, Are you okay? Yes, Im okay, was all I could say. I sat alone in the room not really thinking about anything. Then I returned to Hank, told him a little bit about my unusual workshop but I didnt tell him then what Fred said to me. Later that night I saw Fred one more time at a dance our event put on. As soon as I saw him I went over to give him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and I said thank you. He smiled. He didnt say anything, though. We parted and I went back to Hank and we danced the night away. I remember looking for Fred in the dance room but I never saw him again. I regret not knowing his last name or not asking for his contact information. I tried to find out more about him so I could contact him but the organizers of the event couldnt help me without a last name.

2141,OBE,1341,66,,F,"I decided to take a Past-Life Workshop in the small, homey office of a hypnotist in Katonah, New York last year. Besides the hypnotist, another woman and myself were present. Before the session started, the pleasant hypnotist explained that she was going to hypnotize us. (I tried hypnosis one other time in my life but I couldnt be hypnotized. I thought, however, that I would try it again.) She said we would be going down a long flight of stairs. As we went down, we would be getting more and more tired. When we reached the bottom of the stairs, we would be hypnotized. Then she would direct us to go into a room where we would see who we were and where we were in our past life. It all sounded pretty okay, nothing scary. So, sitting in comfortable chairs, we closed our eyes and the leader directed us down a long flight of stairs. I remember the stairway was dark, but not frightening, and I was getting more and more tired. At the bottom of the stairs, she told us to open the door in front of us and go into the room but I saw a window opened and I flew out instead. I flew out into the dark universe. I wasnt in a spacecraft, it was just me flying. I remember just flying around in the darkness but not feeling afraid. I have a sensation that I was a young woman then, not my senior age at the time of this STE. I never actually heard anything. My experience was silent. I dont remember feeling cold or hot, but just right. I was wearing an ordinary set of clothes--pants and a top. I remember loving the experience of flying. I felt peaceful, serene and happy. I was flying alone, although I have a sense that my husband, Hank, was there from time to time. I remember seeing faraway stars and planets but I didnt land on anything. I was in heaven, in more ways than one. At some point I became aware that I was struggling to do something--waking up. I didnt want to leave the universe, I was enjoying flying so much, but I was awakening to my present human reality in the hypnotists office. When I awoke, the other woman was already awake. The hypnotist asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said I was having a hard time waking up. She thought I fell asleep but I told her I wasnt sleeping. The other woman talked about her experience and then I talked about my flying experience. The woman and hypnotist didnt say anything while I was describing my OBE. The session ended pretty much there. I remember feeling strange about being in this strange world on Earth. I wasnt sure I was okay enough to go out into the street and drive my car home, but I was. I can still feel myself flying in the dark universe, feeling peaceful and happy. I hope that, when Im on my deathbed, I am able to call upon this feeling when it is my time to pass on into Eternity.

2152,ADC,1187,43,,F,"One night after Cloy\xe2\x80\x99s funeral I was lying in my bed in the middle of the night unable to sleep. I was experiencing incredible deep agonizing emotional pain. I had left a church that I knew wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true and I had been ostracized by family and friends for doing so. I was divorced and felt so alone in the world as a single mother. I was curled up in a ball, hugging my knees closely to my chest. I always shook when I cried. It was as if something was trying to shake loose inside of me to finally be free, but it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make its way out, and so I was strangling, squirming for spiritual air. I cried and trembled. Suddenly something other-wordly occurred. I saw Cloy at the end of the hallway. She came towards me into my room. I recognized her because of her outer form. I say outer form because she was translucent, yet color filled, if that makes any sense. I could see through her, yet I could recognize completely that it was her. As she came towards me I said in exclamation, Cloy!\xe2\x80\x9d  It is difficult to describe what happened after that because words cannot describe what occurred next. There simply are no words on this planet for it. All that I can say is that Cloy somehow filled me with what she feels wherever she now is. Suddenly I felt as if someone had placed a needle about two to three inches long in each and every pore over my entire body, starting at the top of my head and ending with the bottom of my toes. The needles had something in them that was the essence of pure unadulterated ecstasy. It was a joy that I have never felt in this earthly existence, and I am certain that it does not exist at the earthly level of vibrational being. The needles tingled full of warm bubbly unconditional love. It was Christmas and Valentines and Halloween all in one. It was chocolate kisses and truffles and the sweet nectar of watercress fresh out of the mountain spring. It was children\xe2\x80\x99s laughter and hugs and unity squared. I was in a state of complete euphoria and exultation that I have never before or since experienced. I was involuntarily smiling from ear to ear. I could feel myself smiling, but it was not me doing it. Seconds before I had been in utter agony. Now, I was so overcome with happiness, that the smile on my face felt permanent. I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not smiling I am being smiled!\xe2\x80\x9d  I lay in the midst of this pleasure and rapture as the needles continued to tingle and pour warm, pure, syrupy, liquid affection into my veins. The veins carried it swiftly to my major organs and I breathed tender compassion. My blood became a river of sweet adulation. I then realized that if there were a drug that could reproduce that feeling \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d be on it twenty-four-seven. As a social worker dealing with methamphetamine users, I had wondered why in the world these people would take drugs and lose everything for it. Instantaneously I knew the answer. I mean, if it feels anything like what I felt that night, I can understand why someone would sell their soul for it. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this feeling was ethereal from another realm. I could only guess that Cloy was aware of my secret agony and she was giving me the ecstatic feeling that is constantly present wherever she is to assuage my pain. The message of the feeling was one of (and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to say this in words because it was conveyed to me beyond words \xe2\x80\x93 it was communicated soul to soul, mind to mind \xe2\x80\x93 words just cheapen it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how else to describe it except with words) \xe2\x80\x9cJane, you are loved unconditionally and you are OK just the way you are.

There is only love.\xe2\x80\x9d   I closed my eyes and luxuriated in the heavenly tingling. Eventually it subsided. The needles slowly pulled out of my body, starting at the top of my head and finally leaving altogether through the ends of my toes. I am thankful to Cloy for showing me such support and joy.

2156,DEE,1541,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

I looked up and viewed the scene beyond my tree very large weeping willow trees in the distance, flowers and plants in front of them. The willow trees were gently blowing in the breeze. I just suddenly experienced this intense awareness/knowledge/feeling that everything in the universe was part of one whole, that everything was connected to everything else, and that everything was just the way it was supposed to be. It is very difficult to put this into words. It wasnt an awareness that dawned on me slowly. It occurred instantly, and in that moment of insight, I understood that everything in the universe was as it should be, and that everything was alright.

2160,NDA,1047,35,,M,"She was very weak, had stopped eating and couldnt swallow even an eyedropper of water. She slipped back and forth between consciousness and being non-responsive. the event began casually enough, with her periodically asking Who is that person across the room. Hospice warned me this could happen. Of course I would look and no one was there so I would say I dont know. After a couple more times of mentioning that people were standing across the room, they became closer. At one point, she saw 2 people standing right next to my sister at her bedside. My mom asked my sister Who is that? My sister asked Where? and my mom said Right beside you! Of course that totally creeped out my sister! Keep in mind that although Hospice had given her morphine which I was to deliver as needed, after the first and only time I gave it to my mom, after a few hours she woke up and asked me what I had given her. I told her morphine for the pain. She said They told me Im not supposed to take it so please dont give it to me again. I did not. So the incidents of her seeing people were becoming more frequent and she mentioned a Benjamin which my father said must have been one of her favorite distant relatives that had passed on well before I was born. He said my mother always had a connection with Benjamin in life and that they were good friends. She also saw both her parents and would carry on conversations with them. I would sit by her bedside, holding her hand and she would seem unresponsive yet mumbling as if she was talking to someone. At one point, she was talking to her deceased father, I guess, because my dad and I kept hearing the occasional Daddy come out of her mouth. All of a sudden her eyes would open and she would look directly at me and ask Can you please tell Daddy (or Aline her mother) to come back? I want to talk to them again. One morning, she asked me to go get my father, which I did. She said to him Joe I love you. He said I love you too. She said I dont know whether to LET them help me leave. (We knew she meant her parents and the others she had been talking to). My father asked If you went with them, would you be happy? She said OH YES! Then he said Well, then, you should go. Sometime after that point, they told her what time she would be departing. 1:30. We didnt know whether that meant AM or PM but her demeanor was one of anticipation. She was almost excited. She kept asking (felt like every 5 minutes) What time is it? What time is it now? What about now? Despite our grief, we had to chuckle at her reaction. After that, the next day the chaplin was scheduled to visit at 9:30 am. He called at 9:00 am to say he would be delayed. He told me he would be able to get there at 1;30 pm. the coincidence totally escaped me at that time. I walked into the bedroom and my mom perked up and asked Who was on the phone? (which by the way is really out-of-character for someone who is in a non-responsive state almost 24/7. At that point, she didnt even act as though she knew she was in her own bedroom). I told her it was the chaplin and that he would be there at 1:30 pm. She exclaimed HOW DOES HE KNOW? I had to laugh! I told her He doesnt think you are going to die at 1:30! Hes just late! (little did I know!) So, fast-forward to 1:00 pm. Tracy, the aide was with my mom and I had gone down to my house to bathe and change clothes. A very strong thought popped into my head GET DOWN THERE! I looked at the clock and it was 1:15 pm. My only thought at that point was that I didnt want to miss the chaplin. I ran down the street and met him on the sidewalk as he was leaving. After a brief exchange, I hurried into the bedroom whereby Tracy promptly grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me into the bathroom. Wide-eyed she said I just saw something! Ive never seen anything! I just saw a BIRD fly into your mothers hospital gown! It flew inside the fabric! I saw the gown billow up as it flew across her heart. Then it disappeared! I was speechless. I said come on! and we went back into the room. My mother was having trouble breathing and her lips where turning blue. I looked and Tracy and said this is it, isnt it? Very quickly, my moms skin flashed blue (anoxia?) yellow (jaundice?) then pink/grey again almost like technicolor and at the same time I could hear her lungs filling up with fluid very quickly. No longer able to take a breath, she quickly expired. It was 1:30 pm.

2164,NDE,1093,29,,F,"The next thing I became aware of after being in the hallway was seeing my body below me. I was lying on a table, my lower half covered in blue draping. There was a doctor handing someting to a person at my right shoulder who took it and quickly and turned her back to me. I saw her arms moving very quickly, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what she was doing. There was blood all over my abdomen. Another doctor was threading something into my chest, he was at my left side. Someone else came into the room to my right.  I was \xe2\x80\x9cfloating\xe2\x80\x9d past the ceiling. I was aware of this detail and found it interesting. I was \xe2\x80\x9cKrista\xe2\x80\x9d but not attached to the body below or the events going on in the room. I was simply an observer. I wanted to keep watching but was pulled to my left by a very strong force. I resisted only for an instant, then knew I must go. It was almost as if I was \xe2\x80\x9csucked\xe2\x80\x9d into this tunnel-like space. There were no defining \xe2\x80\x9cwalls\xe2\x80\x9d, only a static-like grey/white/black type of atmosphere throughout. I was a part of this static. I was moving at lightening speed. There was no time, and I remained Krista throughout the entire event. In the tunnel I next felt the bliss of all-penetrating, all encompassing love. No words can describe this feeling. I was \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d. All the questions I\xe2\x80\x99d ever had in my life were answered in an instant. The confirmation I was given was that we are here to love one another. Period. We are here to love. The next thing that happened was I was emerging from the static to a light grey illumination that was sort of milky cloudy in substance. There were beings lined up to my left, waiting for me to arrive. I did not know any of these beings. There was a young boy, around 12, who wore a round brimmed hat, like a child would have in the 1800\xe2\x80\x99s. For an instant I wanted to be there, then I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I was back in the tunnel very briefly when it opened up to this vast, indescribably beautiful landscape. Breathtaking. I was immensely joyful and so very loved by it and everything. There were bright yellow flowers spread out across the ground in front of me. A forest lay to the right. A rock waterfall surrounded in lush greenery to the left. Past the flowers were undulating green grass hills dotted with trees and a bright blue sky above. It was Eden. It was home. In an instant I was given the choice to leave and I did. I knew I needed to be back here and be a mother. My next memory was of being in the ICU.

2187,ME ,1406,55,,M,"  In 1954 I was born in Astoria Queens, NYC and brought up in the Diocese of Brooklyn. I attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel School and Church. My family moved to Northern New Jersey and I finished my Catholic School in Immaculate Conception in Franklin NJ Diocese of Patterson. To my parents credit one can see where the foundation of my Catholic Faith was formed. I was dragged to church. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there so eventually when I was old enough I left. I lived a very sinful life. One can only imagine where I was but I was not with God. I joined the Navy and began to become an adult and my world did not include God. Things happened to me that in retrospect God must have chose me for better things because my Guardian Angle was very busy.  I met Protestants, while in the Navy. These people were FIRED UP FOR THE LORD. They were obnoxious thumping their Bibles. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them. Finally in 1975 I associated with them enough that in Key West Baptist Church I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. The evil one still had a hold on me and I soon returned to my secular and sinful way of life. As we headed east for Desert Storm in 1990 there were definately more Christians than I have ever seen on an Aircraft Carrier before in my life. History is what it is with that war. Prayer works. Never doubt it.   I did get married to Paula in 1982 in St. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s Church in Sussex NJ. We had a good life as a Navy couple. We attended Mass sometimes mostly non-denominational services. For some reason I developed an attitude toward the Catholic Church.  I retired from the Navy in 1999 and by 2003 we found ourselves in Warrenton VA attending the Warrenton Presbyterian Church. Make no mistake the Pastor and congregation of Warrenton Presbyterian are blessed people. I had attended a Methodist Church for a couple of years, while living in NY so going to church now in my life became a necessary event. But I still was not dedicated to it. I had a Protestant perspective on forgiveness, which is what the Bible says happens if we repent; That is what I was taught by Protestants, however it still is not the teaching of the Catholic Church.  Life was good life was bad. I had some financial difficulties with other obstacles in life and I earnestly prayed to God that he help me get my life in order. Paula and I by the grace of Divine Providence found St. John the Evangelist church in Warrenton VA about 2006. It reminded us of our old time Catholic up bringing and we both felt like re returned home. We stayed.   Now in 2012 at age 57 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to back track. At age 54 or 55 I attended Mass during Easter. Father Cozy discussed the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Saint Faustina. I thought it was interesting that all one had to do was say this chaplet for salvation. Fr. Cozy had planted one of the larger mustard seeds of faith in me, no doubt. As a government contractor my customer was the Navy. I was able to walk the walk and talk the talk with Sailors so I excelled at my job (at least I thought I did). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I was age 55 that I bought my copy of St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary. I had to ride two large deck helicopter and aircraft carriers in a month\xe2\x80\x99s time so my travel to west coast gave me plenty of time to read the diary. I read through St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary like a novel. I eventually realized this was a 20th Century Saint talking directly to me. She was talking directly to me! Through Providence I started saying one Hail Mary a day also eventually this lead up to a full Rosary. I guess the door with no doorknob on my heart was being opened to Jesus. Things started to happen. While on one of the ships I shared a stateroom with two Harrier Pilots. They were both Catholic and noticed what I was reading. We shared some fellowship. I finished the Diary and it was like there was a bonus CD in the back of the book. The bonus was St. Faustina stayed with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say apparition in this essay, but I will say \xe2\x80\x9cheightened spiritual awareness.\xe2\x80\x9d I had this sense Sister was with me. I attended my first Divine Mercy Service that Easter and completed the novena prior to that. I was able to venerate and kiss a first class relic of St. Faustina during the service a woman had and shared with us all. It was about this time in May that I was coming home form work. I pulled in my driveway and was gathering my wits when in my interior voice. The interior voice! In my interior voice from nowhere I heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice say thank you. The voice was so beautiful and melodic. It could only be associated with Our Blessed Mother. I paused and took it in. Hopefully I said a prayer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember but I probably did.

2188,DEE,1425,33,,M,"I awake to nothing. No body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space: no near, no far, no light or dark. No heat, no cold. No emotion: no joy, no fear. Just calm awareness in a gray void. A moment / eternity passes. Light! A brilliant sun! And with it, darkness: the fullness of empty space. A small human figure stands in silhouette. My consciousness shifts. I become the figure; a human body standing in space before a radiant globe. I feel! I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished. I become aware that what had first appeared like a sun is un-like anything from ordinary reality. I am in the presence of a radiant, fluid luminosity. An amalgam of water and light is the best approximation I can think of. The sense of being before a conscious presence intensifies. My mind buzzes with the desire to hold It, to explain and contain It with my thought. The more I grasp, however, the more It slips away. It cannot be grasped or named. I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away. I become light. I am one with the light. I am the light, a fluid, radiant luminosity. I have no body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light. A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body.

Startled, yet at peace, looked up to see the deceased form of one of my fathers closest friends, a small town surgeon. Dr. Pauls hands went to the small of my back while simultaneously radiating incredible warmth and energy into the damaged lumbar area. I clearly proclaimed, I miss you Dr. Paul. He smiled, and after standing there for what seemed an eternity, drew his hands from my back, stepped away slowly and faded before my eyes. I immediately arose and went to my desk. For two hours I sat motionless while I recounted vivid memories of the man who had helped a boy whose father was killed when I was eight years old. Not until I stood up, did I realize that my back pain was completely gone, and had no idea that I would be pain free for the next ten years. I shall never forget Dr. Paul Myers.

2199,SDE,1308,41,,F,"After I fell to the ground and my father was with me we chatted like normal, then all of a sudden he said we have to go and see my step-mother and brother. The whole time I experienced this the beautiful warmth and light was upon me, to describe the light as best I can, is like having a massive spotlight place over you and the rim of the light is pure white and protective, inside the light is the perfect warmth, like the temperature is set to perfection. As we walked over to my step-mother I said to her please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know this, I then placed my hand just under her left shoulder and just above her breast and said Dad wants you to know he loves you with all his heart and soul the look on my step-mothers face was shock and tears welled in her eyes. We then walked over to my Brother (who had a 20 yr feud with my sister) I said to him again, please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know, with that I then placed my hand over his stomach, and said Dad understands the feud between he and my sister is deep seated within them and could they please let the past be and find a way to love each other again, my brother was also shocked....I told him again, not to be afraid. After I gave these messages to my family, we walked over to a rose garden, the whole time the light was with me and the most beautiful, euphoric feeling I can not describe was with me. In between the messages I kept repeating to Dad how beautiful it was. When we sat at the rose garden, Dad asked me if there was anything they could do (we werent allowed to tell him during the week he was dying) I said there wasnt the cancer had spread to most of his body and I just kept also repeating Look Dad, look how beautiful it is I was just in awe of it. With that he was gone and I was back to reality. I returned to the motel we were staying at, thinking that the experience was spurred on by lack of sleep or stress. I thought I was losing my mind. Later that day I returned to the Hospital and was in the kitchen when a nurse came in and I told her that I thought I had lost my mind and was it normal when a loved one was dying, I told her about what I had experienced and thinking she would agree that it was stress induced, the nurse (Paula) then stated that is exactly what Dad would experience when he does finally pass. I was shocked. We both returned to Dads room only to find he was awake and outside in the courtyard, with two other nurses beside him. We couldnt believe it. He was telling my brother, as best he could as for most of the week it was hard to make sense out of much he was saying to us, he told my brother he had enough and then looked straight at me and said I have had enough Im ready to go because its beautiful isnt it buttons (a nickname Dad callled me) I was shocked but replied with a smile and said It certainly is Dad. The most wonderful calm came across me and I knew then everything would be alright. Paula (the nurse) then placed her hand on my shoulder and said, There is your confirmation. Later the next day, we all couldnt believe it when my brother and sister were standing in Dads room, hugging each other and genuinely sharing a laugh together. I then softly whispered in Dads ear, See Dad, you did it, I heard you and they are getting along now, everything is ok and you can go now. I know he heard me as I felt a weak grip on my hand as I was holding his hand. A few days later I found out that the messages I had given to my step-mother and brother were almost identical to what my Dad was trying to say the morning I had the experience with my father.

2200,ME ,1440,21,,F,"Dear Dr. Alexander, Thank you so much for your book, Proof of Heaven. I have not had a NDE, but I experience a variety of connections with/in my own body. I thought I would share them with you so that you might be able to incorporate these ideas and implications into the knowledge you now possess. Mini-bio: I am 32 years old, lesbian, a former college athlete, white, middle-class/U.S., non-religious. When I was in my teens, I was inexplicably drawn to spiritual books for the greater part of 2-3 years, and then that continued into college (previously, I detested reading anything). There was no explanation for this; I detested organized religion as well. I read books by Brian Weiss Many Lives, Many Masters; Charles Tart (actually flew to California to see him speak); Gary Schwartz, among many others. I found myself reading anything and everything I could find on reincarnation, psychics, NDEs, mystical ideas and the like. As I read more, it seemed like the reading experience was such that the more I read, the deeper I went into things I already knew...and that is what kept me reading. In part, I also think that I connected this knowledge with a more sociological knowledge of the body/spirit, particularly by way of sexuality since I was also, simultaneously, coming into the awakening of my sexuality and the relationship between aesthetic experience and physical sensation. For me, there was this immediate connection between sexuality and spirituality. At any rate, I went on in college to major in psychology, sociology, and religion/philosophy. I was one of the very few students in school that defended the reality of psi phenomenon, having never literally not really experienced it myself up to that point. I read the stories and just knew they were real. As I read more, and defended the idea more and more, I began to experience more in the way of expanded consciousness. All of this started shortly after this 2-3 year stint of reading. My clairvoyance is somehow limited by time; I know things are going to happen and Im informed of them, but only about 10 minutes prior. I receive information/images in the waking state in the form of symbolic interactions i.e. ideas are communicated by the meaning my psyche will construct if I cogitate about what very material relations actually mean or feel like specifically to me i.e. the particular is what carries the universal intent of the message/the lesson. In your terminology, I think that is my bodys way of adapting to the inflow of messages that it knows are from the outside. Most often, it goes like this: I will be receiving information that I can feel is information coming through and I will pay very close attention to the content because I know it is not just my own random thoughts (i.e. I would probably be a good receiver in telepathic studies). I will then obsess about what I can make of the structural relations of that content in the very context of my theoretical/sociological categories/knowledge...because it seems to me that it is in figuring out that puzzle that explains why it is that Im receiving that message. Sometimes I can figure out who it needs to reach. I guess this ties in with the quotation on your website that all thoughts and actions are interconnected...and that is true at every level. Story 2: Although it may have nothing or everything do with me, the night I was on my bed studying, crying, and mourning my deceased cousin who died the night prior she came to visit me by staging a physical impossibility... because she knew that would register to me (Im also a very scientific mind I see the possible by way of the impossible. My family makes fun of me for always asking for percentages and probabilities in all aspects of life). :) Anyway, the night prior to this, I remember the light bulb above my bed blowing out I could hear the filament hit the glass of the bulb. Nonetheless, I had left the light switch up/circuit open. As I was sitting there crying the second night, thinking about Beth, and feeling guilty that we had not connected more the year before when she requested that, the light illuminated in a fashion akin to those lights that very gradually get brighter/lighter by touch. It lasted for about 10 seconds. It illuminated in a way that is not possible given the type of light it is; it wasnt on a dimmer switch. And the visual was as if a blast of energy had simply traveled through the space. I know to a degree of 100% that this light bulb had totally and completely blown out the night prior. I was sitting in the exact same place. I immediately knew it was her, and was immediately brought to tears, again. I verbally thanked her. The next day I took the light bulb to a philosophy professor of mine who was very familiar with modern physics. He was a materialist.

2202,ME ,1451,24,,M,"Detail may take a bit more space than there is here, but I will attempt. Briefly, very tired, I fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed like the beginning of a dream sequence, I found myself on the second floor of a mansion in town that I was quite personally familiar with. From a spot in the hall, I noticed flashing lights coming from the hallway of the west wing. Irritated and needing to investigate I went in their direction. Where the halls joined at a right angle, still more lights and, of all people, my great aunt staring into the lights at the end of the hall. Very agitated at this occurence, not knowing if it was fire, or some other upset that required my attention, I began a trot in its direction. At that point I recall (kind of like Santas reindeer!) a lifting of my feet and legs and up I went. In very short order all went dark, all fell away (my body, place, circumstances)and the essential me of me was involved in an ascent...until coming to said portal mentioned earlier in which all I can recall were cloudlike formations over a cauldronlike (and that word is not to have any negative connotation) basis...with what was bubbling up from the cauldron mixing in with the clouds above it and this was perfection and creation in action. My KNOWING at that time was that I was in everything, everything was in me, and that everything was in a perfect balance. The other notion I had was that the energy was so powerful that if it were withdrawn everything would collapse, but that that would not happen...furthermore, the word calibrated came to mind. As in, everything was perfectly calibrated to hold only its allotment of that energy, and that one-zillionth more of it and a body would burst into bits. At the portals edge, even though I had no body or even much in the way of caring about what had happened to it, I do recall my hands grabbing the portals edge and I kind of docked there and went no further...only witnessed the roiling of the generator of all that is, was and would be (as described before.) At about the point of docking and peering in, I was conscious, alert, awake and aware, and said to myself: OMG, Im dying! and then something to the effect of I didnt want to do that. (That would be the distressing part and I almost clicked another choice for 42.) As soon as I said that the experience of coming down began, the up there having been short-circuited by my ambivalence or fear...even as I quick-changed my mind and said, No, NO! (leave me up here for a while longer.) The coming down was not so memorable in and of itself. What there is to know is that I did then and still do sleep on my back...and I felt as if my feet were the first to gain life back and then the descent of the rest back down as if my astral back to stomach and like that. As my arms were folded across my chest, they were the last to come to and I recall being conscious of that happening. Upon full re-entry I was quite astonished at the whole thing and lept out of bed as if every cell was on fire and said Holy S**t, Theres nothing I cant do! Later on I went at myself over that notion-thinking that it was a bit egocentric, but I digress. I further recall that everything in the room had a bit of a glow to it, and so probably did I. I also remember being fascinated at a pencil in my room. Its interiority struck me as magnificent...and to think that none of it (me, my body, material circumstances) had mattered or even existed just moments before was quite startling.

2207,ADC,1385,37,,F,"    After closing the front door shut, I looked up to see this very sad look on my Daughters face, she was crying. I didnt think for one minute she was dead. I told her to come down off the stairs and she just looked at me blankly, pleadingly. That look will haunt me all my life. It was then I noticed my dressing gown belt, which was made of a silk like material around her neck. Reflecting back on this, I realise now that the stitches had broken so this had stretched giving the illusion, Tracey was standing on the stairs, leaning against the wall.    Thinking she was unconscious but alive, I realised by locking the door, I had locked out any chance of help from neighbours. I asked my little girl to go in the kitchen and get a chair. Put it near the bench and stand on it. On the top of the cabinets above, there are some scissors, bring them to me?    Bless her, she done everything asked of her while I held Tracey from her own weight. My little boy cried and cried and cried in a panic and was too young to understand the urgency what was going on around him other than he knew there was something very wrong.     I cut my Daughter free, called 999 then started Life saving techniques. I did have the support of the emergency service by phone. Although the ambulance service is a five minute journey to my home, I found out later there was a mix-up as the houses were within the first six months of building and the postcode had not gone on the register.     Thirty five minutes later, with a two year old still screaming and a five year old who thought there was blood on her sisters neck when actually was the marks like rubber bands make if you leave them a while around your wrist.     This was so traumatic for everyone who knew her. I also has two other children to consider. One aged thirteen who my now dead Daughter was very close to and my eldest Daughter, who was married and living in army quarters of Germany    Without my other children, I would not be here today. They gave me a reason to go on. They had suffered enough. My Daughter was pronounced dead when the ambulance eventually arrived.

I sat in a circular cozy sofa and closed my eyes and my consciousness entered a dimension where it felt as if I had tapped into an eternal network of knowledge. Bursts of ideas regarding life and its wonders popped into my consciousness like bubbles, each identifying value which could not be explained by words very easily. An understanding of love was undeniable as it clearly is the adhesive force binding all of life. I understood that life requires a balance of the extremes and that death is nothing to fear but simply the critical point where our spirits transcend the physical realm. I could not see anything worth noting but the knowledge brought to my attention introduced me to the most profound spiritual presence I could ever ask to experience.

I remember quite well, that I either speeded up my forward and sideways movement, or The Presence slowed down to the point when we merged togather and I was completely filled with the most Profound Living Love and Profound Living Peace. I realized immediately that I was being loved like I had never known possible. It was Total and Complete and Profoundly Pure! There were quite a few Profoundly Loving Souls there with and through me all at the same time. The experience was far more real than anything I could have ever imagined.

2245,SDE,1277,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

2253,ADC,1153,44,,F,"My best friend passed into Spirit on May 15, 2004 at the age of 45, after a 10 year battle with HER-2 Breast Cancer. We had spent 40 years weaving the fabric of our lives together in a dance that was just magical. Ours is a long story of love and friendship. It is hard to relay in a few words the significance of this miracle,but I will try.  Two years ago Karen started having massive headaches and was feeling weird. We were headed off to a healing weekend in New York State and having a grand time. It was just the two of us tooling around in the car and laughing and enjoying each others company. At one point, she became very serious and told me she thought her chemotherapy may be causing these symptoms. She was struggling as to whether or not to go off the chemo and just let God do His work. I told her this was a huge decision and one not to be taken lightly. I am a big believer in asking God to give us a sign when we need an answer to an important or not so important question. Because this was a VERY important question, I told her she needed to ask for a sign that would be unquestionable! Something so unusual that it could only be from God. I then said, How about if we see a green donkey? Then you can go off chemotherapy. She giggled and said, That sounds great. The rest of the weekend we searched for a green donkey. We found yellow pigs, purple cows, red dogs and even a green horse.How we tried to rationalize that a horse is almost a donkey. But we knew it had to be a Green Donkey. We even spent the next afternoon in Woodstock, NY going through every store but never found a green donkey. A week later the headaches continued and she went for an MRI. Her father also passed away from Alzheimers this same week. On the morning of his funeral, she received a phone call from her oncologist telling her the cancer had spread to her brain. She went through the whole day, a huge funeral, and never told a soul except her husband what she had found out that morning. She had courage beyond human strength. She made it through brain surgery and massive radiation and lived two more years. She passed on May 15, 2004 surrounded by her whole family. What follows is what I said at her memorial service (which 700 people attended). Notice the part about the green donkey toward the end. I have had the pleasure of knowing Karen for over 40 years and calling her one of my best and dearest friends. But I know I am just one of countless best friends that Karen had...there was something about her that just made you want to be close to her and know her better. To Karens family...she was a mom, a wife, a sister, a daughter, and a cousin, but for the vast majority of us here today, she was our friend. A friend of the truest sense and one that was there for each of us no matter what was going on in her life. Remarkable, selfless, trustworthy, sincere, kind, compassionate, spiritual, and beautiful are words that can only begin to describe Karen. Besides being a friend,Karen was a teacher. She taught me more about strength and courage than I ever wanted to know. When my son deployed to Afghanistan last Oct, she came to me one day like an angel sent from God. She held me, cried with me and instilled in me The Power of Now. This gave me strength that I did not know I had. If I can take one tenth of her strength and live the rest of my life, then I will be happy. I will miss her human presence more than I can even imagine at this time... her spirit while she was on this Earth was immeasurable. What I look forward to from this day on is how she will guide, love, and watch over each of us in her new found strength in SPIRIT. And so I say to you my dear Karen, Godspeed to you on this new journey you have undertaken. I know Daddy was holding your green donkey and that now you know all the Divine Order that is so hard for us to understand here on Earth. I giggle at the thought of our next life together and I ask you Sister Karen to hold down the abbey until I get there. When I returned home from her service that evening, there was a message on my answering machine from my son, who was in Afghanistan, serving in the US Army. He had never, ever called on a weeknight since he had deployed, until that night. This in and of itself spoke volumes to me. I was sad I had missed his call, but I knew he was OK and surely sending me some love from afar, even though he did not know of Karens death yet. Karen had given me extreme comfort and support while she was alive in regards to his deployment and no matter what was going on in her life, she always asked how my son was doing. That same night, the phone rang again around 2:30 AM and it was my son. What a joy to hear his voice! We spoke for about 20 minutes and during the conversation he mentioned that his best buddy and teammate had put new pictures up on a website ",,Citizen,1 2000,spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,very strong,moder,"0 24,999",colle,At the,,single,single,No,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

2260,ME ,1406,55,,M,"  In 1954 I was born in Astoria Queens, NYC and brought up in the Diocese of Brooklyn. I attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel School and Church. My family moved to Northern New Jersey and I finished my Catholic School in Immaculate Conception in Franklin NJ Diocese of Patterson. To my parents credit one can see where the foundation of my Catholic Faith was formed. I was dragged to church. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there so eventually when I was old enough I left. I lived a very sinful life. One can only imagine where I was but I was not with God. I joined the Navy and began to become an adult and my world did not include God. Things happened to me that in retrospect God must have chose me for better things because my Guardian Angle was very busy.  I met Protestants, while in the Navy. These people were FIRED UP FOR THE LORD. They were obnoxious thumping their Bibles. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them. Finally in 1975 I associated with them enough that in Key West Baptist Church I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. The evil one still had a hold on me and I soon returned to my secular and sinful way of life. As we headed east for Desert Storm in 1990 there were definately more Christians than I have ever seen on an Aircraft Carrier before in my life. History is what it is with that war. Prayer works. Never doubt it.   I did get married to Paula in 1982 in St. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s Church in Sussex NJ. We had a good life as a Navy couple. We attended Mass sometimes mostly non-denominational services. For some reason I developed an attitude toward the Catholic Church.  I retired from the Navy in 1999 and by 2003 we found ourselves in Warrenton VA attending the Warrenton Presbyterian Church. Make no mistake the Pastor and congregation of Warrenton Presbyterian are blessed people. I had attended a Methodist Church for a couple of years, while living in NY so going to church now in my life became a necessary event. But I still was not dedicated to it. I had a Protestant perspective on forgiveness, which is what the Bible says happens if we repent; That is what I was taught by Protestants, however it still is not the teaching of the Catholic Church.  Life was good life was bad. I had some financial difficulties with other obstacles in life and I earnestly prayed to God that he help me get my life in order. Paula and I by the grace of Divine Providence found St. John the Evangelist church in Warrenton VA about 2006. It reminded us of our old time Catholic up bringing and we both felt like re returned home. We stayed.   Now in 2012 at age 57 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to back track. At age 54 or 55 I attended Mass during Easter. Father Cozy discussed the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Saint Faustina. I thought it was interesting that all one had to do was say this chaplet for salvation. Fr. Cozy had planted one of the larger mustard seeds of faith in me, no doubt. As a government contractor my customer was the Navy. I was able to walk the walk and talk the talk with Sailors so I excelled at my job (at least I thought I did). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I was age 55 that I bought my copy of St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary. I had to ride two large deck helicopter and aircraft carriers in a month\xe2\x80\x99s time so my travel to west coast gave me plenty of time to read the diary. I read through St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary like a novel. I eventually realized this was a 20th Century Saint talking directly to me. She was talking directly to me! Through Providence I started saying one Hail Mary a day also eventually this lead up to a full Rosary. I guess the door with no doorknob on my heart was being opened to Jesus. Things started to happen. While on one of the ships I shared a stateroom with two Harrier Pilots. They were both Catholic and noticed what I was reading. We shared some fellowship. I finished the Diary and it was like there was a bonus CD in the back of the book. The bonus was St. Faustina stayed with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say apparition in this essay, but I will say \xe2\x80\x9cheightened spiritual awareness.\xe2\x80\x9d I had this sense Sister was with me. I attended my first Divine Mercy Service that Easter and completed the novena prior to that. I was able to venerate and kiss a first class relic of St. Faustina during the service a woman had and shared with us all. It was about this time in May that I was coming home form work. I pulled in my driveway and was gathering my wits when in my interior voice. The interior voice! In my interior voice from nowhere I heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice say thank you.

I felt supported, like he was saying I will be here to help you and Jeremy through. I was pretty distraught most of the time, but his presence was like an anchor. His being there told me there was life after life and where he was was where my son was going also. So that was comforting.

2273,DEE,1425,33,,M,"I awake to nothing. No body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space: no near, no far, no light or dark. No heat, no cold. No emotion: no joy, no fear. Just calm awareness in a gray void. A moment / eternity passes. Light! A brilliant sun! And with it, darkness: the fullness of empty space. A small human figure stands in silhouette. My consciousness shifts. I become the figure; a human body standing in space before a radiant globe. I feel! I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished. I become aware that what had first appeared like a sun is un-like anything from ordinary reality. I am in the presence of a radiant, fluid luminosity. An amalgam of water and light is the best approximation I can think of. The sense of being before a conscious presence intensifies. My mind buzzes with the desire to hold It, to explain and contain It with my thought. The more I grasp, however, the more It slips away. It cannot be grasped or named. I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away. I become light. I am one with the light. I am the light, a fluid, radiant luminosity. I have no body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light. A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body.

It was like my loved one sent his brother to tell me he couldnt give me that particular sign because it was too overwhelming.

2289,OBE,1521,43,,F,"I had a two part experience with this series. I had an OBE with the first and fourth meditation. In the first meditation I experienced a dropping down into my heart. Once that happened, I felt myself leave my physical body. I found myself in the rings of Saturn. I observed this area for a bit. I could feel something like wind and could hear the planet rotating. I watched as rocky material went by. I say watched, but it wasnt like watching with your eyes. I felt like I was going in a circular motion and felt like I was standing, but not really standing. I shifted my consciousness to look down because I felt like I had moved from the rings to somewhere else. I found my consciousness in the middle of the DNA helix. It seems like I stayed there for quite awhile and could feel a sense of awe. I felt in awe throughout this whole experience. I then found myself sort of floating in what felt and looked like darkness, but not scary darkness more like space darkness. I became aware of a shape, but it was on a mammoth scale. There is nothing that I can even compare it to. It felt like God, OM, greatness. I was then in the middle of what seemed like what would be comparable to the bloodstream. I was moving very fast and saw lots of red around me. This shifted from the bloodstream to the galaxies, other planets, humans, animals, trees, everything. I felt like I was being shown that everything is connected and on an even larger scale, we make (everything) actually makes up God/OM. We are the heart, everything is about the heart. In the 4th mediation I had a similar, but different experience. I dropped down into my heart again, but I stayed there for a bit. I had the sensation that I was laying on my left side. I could hear a muffled heart beat. Not a perfect beat and it sounded as if it may even be skipping beats, but so comforting. I became aware of the feeling of warm fluid all around me and inside my nose, lungs, mouth. I could see my right hand, but it was very tiny and very pink. It was mostly dark, but a little bit of white light was around the edges of this space. I felt as if this was me and I was in my mothers womb. I remember feeling the most comforted I ever have. It was so comforting, but also very confining, but not in a bad way. From there, I felt like I was in a white light spiral. The spiral shot the purest white light through my heart and out of the crown of my head-simultaneously. My consciousness catapulted out of my chest, but also through my head. Up, straight up and fast, but completely enveloped with white light and love. I felt like there were beings that were moving with me, supporting me, but they had no physical characteristics.

2294,ME ,1489,56,,M," By about nine p.m. I noticed that I was hearing songs in a way I never had before. I seemed to be entering more deeply than usual into the mind of the writer and understanding what was being emotionally conveyed. So I kept listening. I felt the sorrows and joys of others as they spoke to me in song. I felt the tragic beauty in the passions, lost hopes and brevity of life as experienced by other people. There was a collision of sadness and beauty, a kind of majestic sorrow. I wondered if it was due to being fifty six years of age and being able to relate to many situations in life. Shivers repeatedly rose in waves up my spine from its base. I could not recall ever enjoying music to such an extent. I identified so closely with the singers, I became them. I could get up and go to the bathroom or get a drink of chilled water from the kitchen without losing the spinal effect. I then returned to the headphones and Yahoo Radio on the computer. The shivers of pleasure continued to rise in waves up my spine and began to intensify and surge down my legs and up my arms. The base of my head, at the rear, where the spine joins the skull was hit by waves of exquisite sensation with each new song. It felt like a hand was gripping the upper back of my neck where it meets the skull, and channelling in high voltage pleasure direct to my brain. After each wave of energy up my spine, this sensation did not totally subside, but seemed to remain as a scintillation of increased magnitude higher than the level before it. I became concerned as the euphoric physical effects intensified and extended in duration. I checked my pulse by the clock to see if I had an elevated heart rate associated with panic attacks. My pulse was normal and steady and my body felt very, very relaxed. I had the sensation of settling or falling back, deeper within my body, as the experience continued. My mind was paradoxically calm, intensely present, sharply aware and my cognition totally functioning and nimble. The waves of sensation up my spine became a volcanic rush that entered my head. I was thinking \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Oh, Oh! Awesome! Go with it!\xe2\x80\x9d Rivers of energy flowed outwards along my limbs. By now it was after midnight. My body felt almost weightless. I felt immense power flowing through my body. At one point I looked at my hands and they felt so full of the sensation of energy and so insubstantial that I wondered if they might pass through the wall if I tried. I touched the wall out of curiosity and my hand was certainly still solid as it touched the wall! It was just that I could not feel my hand. It went on and on, hour after hour as powerful waves of surging energy, ever intensifying. I was totally immersed in intense ecstasy. Suddenly, there was another huge rush of energy upwards. There was complete darkness. I found my locus of consciousness now resting in the centre of my head as a tiny pin point. The room I was sitting in had totally disappeared from sight. It was dark and comforting in the centre of my brain. Then, there was a final atomic eruption I could feel rising beneath this tiny \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d, my centre of total awareness, and it burst forth from the top of my head carrying that tiny point in a massive torrent of energy that felt like a clear, cool viscous liquid, and my awareness emerged into a infinite yet intimate space which was like an endless ocean where I felt connected to all things in the cosmos. I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! I must have died! Oh well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d I had no fear. I was merely a point of consciousness with no body at all. I was overcome with immense gratitude for the privilege of having been alive, and for my life with its joys as well as its sorrows and the total improbability of just being. I thanked God.  Following on was an instantaneous, total life review. It was like viewing a three hundred and sixty degree panoramic picture screen with all of my life events played out simultaneously. Many of the things I had thought very significant in my life were not at all important. My preconceptions of right and wrong melted away. I did not feel judged in any way, I felt completely accepted. Everything was meaningful in my life and nothing I had experienced was wasted. The only things that now mattered in my past life were the times I had shown loving compassion to other people and living things. Then I felt enormous, limitless, feelings of joy, love, compassion and empathy for humankind and all living things. I felt intimate kinship with all humanity.

2300,NDE,1276,45,,M,"My first memories was a sense of unnatural sounds like the building itself was breathing or living somehow. I saw through the walls to a room that I knew was on another dimension or in a spiritual plane. In this room, men sat and leaned against the walls while they waited. I knew somehow that they were waiting to escort the dead to another place. I knew that I was close to death in this moment and that was the reason I could see them. I was not afraid. I just knew it.  My next memory was of a village setting that looked medieval or European. The streets were cobble stone and the buildings were stone as well. People walked in groups down the road. I think a better description would be that they wondered aimlessly. They looked straight ahead, slightly downward and seemed to be without hope. I had an overwhelming feeling of gloom in this place and I felt as though they were being punished or detained in some way.  The thing that was MOST striking about these visions was there absolute vividness. It was as though I was seeing them with the most high definition TV ever seen. I could not explain how powerful this sense of visual clarity was. It was as though it were more real than real life. Even though these people seemed as though they were not supposed to look at me, occasionally one would lock eyes with me for just a moment. They had such despair in their eyes that it saddened me to make eye contact.  Later I was in this same place in a large arena, though that is not really the right word. It was a place in a large building that had a circular path that came in one door and passed in front of what seemed to be stadium type seating.  I had a feeling that people were paraded through this place in the lines I had seen them walking in on the streets to possibly be judged or reviewed in some way. Again, the architecture was like nothing I have seen here in the states. It seemed very old and mostly made from stone.  My next and final memory was my defining moment where I was like a speck dust floating in a space that felt like a large room. I was exactly like those particles of dust that you see floating randomly in the open space of a room as the sunlight passes through a window. I was free, floating on an invisible river of air through this space, around a tree or plant, feeling sheer joy and amazement. I had no identity in these moments. I had no memory of anything personal or earthly. I only knew that I was truly at peace. I was one with the universe, completely accepted, and loved. I felt such joy in those brief moments that it makes my heart race even now as I recall it. As I passed through this space, I saw a very obvious ray of what I thought was sunshine coming downward from the right from no obvious window or light source. I didnt question anything, but I remember a sense of really hoping that I would drift through this light. As I did enter the light, I felt happiness like I have never known. I felt as though anything I had known before this moment was infantile and insignificant. I knew this was the presence of God, though I did not see a face. I dont even know that I had the ability to look at the source of the light. I just basked in its glory.  I saw flashes or arcs of light zipping above me. They looked like just that really, but I felt like they were something bigger than me, something more than I could even try to understand. Later, I remembered seeing a phenomenon called flying rods that I have seen myself in videos that I have where these things that are not visible to the naked eye show up on high speed video and they appear to swim through the sky with multiple wings on a straight translucent body.  I wonder if these could be what I saw in this place. As far as I know this phenomenon is not explained scientifically yet, but you can find hundreds or thousands of video accounts on youtube by searching for flying rods. I may be nothing, but then again...  I had a number of very substantial things that became known to me in this place. For one, the reason that everyone describes these visions as being so vivid is that we are not looking at them with our failing human eyes. We are seeing them in a supernatural state of being where our tired old eyeballs could not even begin to compare. Also, I became acutely aware that I am a being inside of a being. I felt that I am a spirit aside from the conscious brain thought, which I always thought was ME. Suddenly, I had all of these memories of things like driving on long trips when I am complete zoned out in deep thought, yet somehow my body is driving the car, slowing and speeding up in traffic, using turn signals, and yet I arrive 30 miles later not remembering the drive. It occurred to me that there is a watcher within us that is the true us who is ready to take the wheel at any moment if we zone out, so to s",,US Citize,"50,000",religious,spiritual,Unaffilia,Unaffilia,,,weekly,week,very strong,very st,"0 24,999",Some,Compute,,divor,single,Yes,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

2302,SDE,1278,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

2303,DEE,1299,22,,M,"I entered my bedroom, sat down on a cushioned window seat, and the sobbing continued. Moments later, I felt a tingling in my arms, kind of like they had fallen asleep, though I wasnt sitting in a way that impaired blood flow. Moments later, my arms rose from my sides and my hands literally came together in prayer in front of my chest. I watched in complete wonderment as this occurred. And I suddenly felt in my heart a very clear instruction that I needed to get on my knees and pray. But I was refused. I didnt understand why prayer was necessary. In fact, it seemed like an act of subservience that made me uneasy. Meanwhile, my arms and hands were literally vibrating, and my hands were stuck together that literally, I was unable to pull them apart. Why is this happening to me, I wondered. And I suddenly understood that I was dying. No sooner did that thought cross my mind, my hands fell back to my sides--thus making a connection in my mind between the thought I was dying and the release of my hands from the unseen force, and the immediate cessation of the tingling sensations. Given how strange this all was, it seemed perfectly logical to me that I was indeed dying. My mother was spiritual, so I thought I better go downstairs and tell her. In the living room, I sat beside my mother and told her what had just happened. She told me to go ahead and pray. I told her I couldnt, and that I was dying. She was very spiritual. When she heard this, she thought perhaps a part of me was dying, to make room for something else... but I wasnt physically dying. I told her she was wrong. She checked my temperature. I had a fever of 103. She went to get some aspirin, and told me to to relax. After I took the aspirin, I lay down on the living room couch, and thats when a spiritual being showed up. I heard him as clear as day, talking in my head, just as if he was in the room with me. The first thing he said to me was, Ok, lets go! When he said that, I could feel a pulling sensation all of a sudden on the region of my solar plexus. If the soul was real, it felt like he was reaching in and pulling my soul out of my body. It was a very uncomfortable and unusual feeling, and I reacted to it by kicking my feet on the couch. When I did this, the pulling, or suction-y feeling stopped. Long story short, this fight to stay went on for more than an hour. I remained lucid throughout the whole experience, conversing with my family while also telepathically conversing with this Being. The longer I resisted, the more this Being resorted to threatening me. I didnt care--no matter what the threats (Stay and youll be crazy, no one will ever understand you, your family wont remember a thing--their memories will be wiped) I refused to go wherever it was this Being was intent on taking me. Finally, fed up with my refusal, the Being told me he wasnt leaving empty handed. If I didnt come then and there, he would cause my father to have a massive heart attack, and he would take my father. My father and I had had a long and stormy relationship, however, I didnt have to think about that threat. I immediately relented and agreed to come. But I asked to say goodbye to my family first--which he permitted. I literally kissed and hugged everyone who was there and said goodbye. It was the saddest moment I have ever experienced. Then I told the Being I was finally ready, and I heard a voice (a different voice than the Being) tell me it wasnt my time. For a while I pleaded to go. I was ready. But it was no use. My fever broke, and I felt better than I had ever felt in my life-- and I appreciated my life like I had never appreciated it before.

2304,ME ,1431,28,,F,"It was a warm July evening in 2010. I had two 8month-old twin daughters at the time. I got an invitation for a dinner with friends and spent the evening with them. My husband was at home with the girls. I was walking home after the dinner. It was already dark and the city lights were on. I was walking on a deserted street alone when a car passed me. Young men were sitting in it, hearing loud music. I did not really pay attention to them and turned into another street, which was much darker. Suddenly a really strong invisible force hit me, and I staggered into a dark corner near a house. I almost fell, and was shocked. 2 seconds later the same car with the young men appeared in the street. This time they were driving very slowly as if they were looking for something/someone. They could not see me, as I was still in the dark corner of a house. They passed me again, this time the music was off. I realized later that they must have been looking for me. I struggled to get myself together in the corner where I was still crouching. I was shocked because it was clearly not me, who decided to hide in the corner. It was as if someone/something had hit me or shoved me there. I went home at last but I have not told anybody about this experience for a long time, not even my husband.

2307,ADC,1402,29,,F,"At the time, I described it as the most real and vivid dream I have ever had. In the dream, my deceased grandfather was communicating with me. He had passed away approximately ten years earlier and I had always said that I couldnt believe how much I missed him, even so many years after his death. This was my first loss and I took his death very hard because he had always been my father figure- my birth father had never been around (and died when I was 5), AND my relationship with my adoptive father was not close at all. Some specific details of the dream were not clear such as where we were or in what capacity my grandfather came to me, but I do remember that in the dream, I was very aware that it was impossible (in my understanding) for him to be there, communicating with me. My response in the dream was basically, How can this be, you are dead? I dont believe he said much to me, but I was so excited to have this time with him and I remember wanting to introduce him to my life since his death. I had no kids when he died and I wasnt married although I was dating my now husband. So, in the dream, I was feverishly trying to catch him up on all the events of my life...getting married, having two beautiful kids, going to university to become a teacher. I wanted him to be proud of me and I wanted so desperately to keep him around and involved in my life.  When I woke up, I truly felt that I had really lived this dream...a feeling I had never had with a dream and I remember wanting to cry because it was so real and vivid and now that I was awake, I couldnt get it back.

2309,DEE,1369,50,,F,"At the age of 50, I had an experience that transformed my life. I had been working with a tool in a secluded area of my home. I left the room for a few minutes, but when I returned, the tool had \xe2\x80\x9cvanished\xe2\x80\x9d and was never seen again. After exhausting every possible explanation for the disappearance, I felt my world falling apart. For the next few days, all I could do was to walk round and round the house in the hope that somehow the tool would mysteriously reappear. The experience was like being thrown into an alien universe, where all the laws of the only universe I had ever known had ceased to exist \xe2\x80\x93 it was like living in a world without gravity. When I eventually regained my composure, I began thinking of ways to solve the mystery. I had heard that the CIA uses psychics, so I made an appointment with one of these people in my area. Although he could not see what had happened to the tool, the psychic indicated that a being on the other side wanted to communicate with me. He described her as wearing a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s uniform and giving her first name as Edith. He could not understand her surname, but he thought it started with a C or a K. When I suggested \xe2\x80\x9cEdith Cavell\xe2\x80\x9d, he told me that was correct. (He had obviously never heard of the remarkable English nurse). Through the psychic, Edith accurately described a pendant I owned. She said I should hold it completely still and then ask her a question. If the answer was \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99, the pendant would move one way; if the answer was \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99, it would move another way. Being of a sceptical disposition, I did not believe that something I owned could ever move of its own accord. But on arriving home, I did what Edith had suggested and to my absolute astonishment, the pendant moved as she had indicated \xe2\x80\x93 either vertically or horizontally. After a new months of fruitful yes/no communication, I asked Edith a question one day, but instead of its usual movements, the pendant swung around in a circle. Eventually I discovered that a circle indicated the need to rephrase the question. Not long after that, Edith changed her mode of communication to one where she caused my hand to move in different directions. Then one day I asked a question, but there was no response. It turned out that Edith was handing me over to someone else. The only way I could ascertain the name of this being was to go through the alphabet. I found it almost impossible to believe that the name of the new guide I was being given was Aristotle. I was in such a state of anxiety that I contacted a renowned psychic without giving him any information about myself. At the consultation he told me he was being given a vision of philosophers in Ancient Greece. This gave me reassurance that I was not losing my mind. Aristotle told me that I should apply to do a PhD in philosophy, and that I should do a lot of background reading. To this day I have never been to a philosophy lecture \xe2\x80\x93 let alone studied in the field. When I eventually rang the Professor I had chosen, he \xe2\x80\x9cforgot\xe2\x80\x9d to ask me about the previous work I had done in philosophy.  After being accepted by the University, I began a difficult journey, but I had a wonderful supervisor who carried me through. At one point Aristotle said I would need to use a concept by the very early philosopher, Anaximander. Of course I had never heard of this thinker, but I used his concept to unite the various ideas I was presenting. Later on, Aristotle handed me over to the modern French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. By this time I had become used to the miraculous, which was just as well, because I found Jacques\xe2\x80\x99 writing difficult to grasp. In the end, thanks to all the help I was given from the other side, the two examiners I had described my dissertation as \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d. (It is titled \xe2\x80\x9cHeidegger and the mystery of being\xe2\x80\x9d and is on the web). Among other things it addresses the question of mysticism, and I am now interested in relating mystical experiences to the idea of the divine. From what I have read in Dr. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s book, and from my own experience, it seems difficult to conceive of God as an all-powerful being who sends people to hell if they don\xe2\x80\x99t repent. The evidence seems to be overwhelming that the whole of the universe is love.

On the map of India, it drew me to an area called Gujarat (again, I had never heard of this place, but when I googled it, it was exactly where I was shown on the map).

The best way I can describe my most resent experience is like a gnawing feeling at your core that something is wrong, and at the same time an intense feeling of my grandpa. Not him in the sense of physically being next to me, but this feeling of the love we shared, the grief I felt when I lost him, and replaying the experiences we had together. The thoughts of him flood my mind and almost become distracting. My mind would constantly wander back to thoughts of my grandpa and just intense deep feelings. (The first few times this happened to me was when my two of my grandpas brother died, my uncles father in law was dying and my aunt was diagnosed with cancer it wasnt until afterward that I pieced together my intense feelings surrounding my grandpa and the news). After I became aware of my grandpas presence its like I knew something was wrong, and he was trying to tell me or make me aware of something bad. Knowing something was going to happen was unsettling and my mind would race at the possible events that might happen. Then when my phone rang and it was news my uncle had had a massive stroke, it was instant that this what he was telling me. Knowing that my grandpa is here with me is something I can not describe in words...its a feeling you get deep in your gut that you know everything is going to be alright.

He had this wonderful smile on his face and his being generated such great warmth. There were no words shared, but I could feel his love beyond measure for me. It was like our spirits were talking.

I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished.

2343,NDE,1098,37,,F," I started drifting off and could only vaguely hear them now.  I found myself floating down a long tunnel. I looked all around and was aware of a soft and mesmerizing light at the end. I wanted to rush towards it but found it hard to move forward and could do so only by forcing myself forward half swimming, half walking. Then, I heard a distant faint voice cry out \xe2\x80\x9cSinus rhythm collapsing, we are losing her\xe2\x80\x9d but I felt completely disinterested in this. Who was being lost? I did not know who they were talking about and was annoyed at the interruption. Now I only had eyes for the wonderful glowing light at the end of the tunnel which seemed to hold promise of great warmth and love unending. I felt so joyful and excited and all awareness of my body on the bed left me as I tried for some time to reach the light. I knew absolutely that wonderful things were awaiting, if I could only get to the end of the tunnel. The light now loomed larger and I could see faint outlines of figures waiting there, beckoning me forwards. I wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is waiting there, is it Sai Baba, angels or loved ones?\xe2\x80\x9d I tried harder and harder to reach the end of the tunnel.  Then, a very faint voice interrupted my travels with a tiny urgent \xe2\x80\x9cBaby on Board\xe2\x80\x9d and a pleading \xe2\x80\x9cBreathe! You must breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. (A nurse was apparently shouting loudly into my ear). This caught my attention. I stopped in the middle of the tunnel and wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho has a baby on board, who should be breathing?\xe2\x80\x9d And then thought \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is me, perhaps I am pregnant, if I am, then I must go back\xe2\x80\x9d and I turned reluctantly around. It was so hard to leave that wonderful promise of all-encompassing Love and Joy waiting in the Light and those light filled beings waiting there. The return down the tunnel was brutally sudden. I came back to consciousness to experience total chaos, doctors were shouting and my whole body was in pain. I felt icy cold, but I could see I was indeed pregnant. My memories flooded back and I knew I had many children and others who needed me to hold on. I fought to come back and although the heart rhythm was still unstable, immediately went into labour. Serious faced heart specialists told me \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t have the baby yet, we will deliver in two weeks when your heart has settled down\xe2\x80\x9d. I did not argue, I could see their point, but I knew from my previous eight deliveries that this labour was not a trial run. So exhausted, I steeled myself for a long night. Whether it was the right time or not, this baby was on its way. I was informed later that day, that I had flat lined for some time and that had this episode happened at our house, some one hours drive from the nearest hospital, both William and I would have died. I reflected on that urgent message in the morning, no wonder I had to get to hospital that day. How strange the many delays that had led to the nurse colliding with the heart specialist! I realized that I had been somehow protected all the way through this crisis. I also felt enormous gratitude for the nurse who had shouted in my ear, because I realized that I had only turned back because of her prompting as all knowledge of my present life had been wiped out. At dawn the following morning with labour well advanced, a grim faced team of Heart specialists and surgeons gathered to deliver the baby. I was hooked to a bank of heart monitors, and had needles in my feet, arms and hands. The recalcitrant heart was still racing and wobbling around. Their ominous expressions told me that they didnt give much for our chances under anaesthetic.   Would you like to leave any messages? I was asked. None, I replied. My husband and children knew I loved them, I told them that every day. Since seeing the two little boys standing together on that planet four years earlier in the OOBE, I felt sure that William at least, would survive to be with his brother. As the anesthetic took hold, I felt totally at peace, after all I had come close to the Light and it was so wonderful, I had no fear of death left. William was delivered with only minor difficulties apparently unharmed by his pre-natal adventure in the Star Trek ship!

The book is written I am told, at a sixth grade level and it has about 140 pages. So I ate it up and read it in about 3 days. After reading it I thought to myself. This book makes so much sense. Just 4 agreements and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to memorize a bunch of affirmations and make sure that I find the right one to say for the situation in my stack of 3X5\xe2\x80\x99 cards. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking this is one of the best books I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and it\xe2\x80\x99s so simple to understand and implement. So I go in for round two with this book. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read it again. About half way through the book is when it happens. My vision: It\xe2\x80\x99s 10:00am and I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting at my home office desk reading the book for the second time. The morning light is shining through my French doors. I\xe2\x80\x99m about half way through it when the room goes dark. I turn my chair to the left toward the light switch to see who\xe2\x80\x99s there. I stand and I drop the book to the floor out of my left hand. My desk is to my right. The book lands on a wood floor, bounces a couple of times and makes an echo like a book bouncing on a wood floor in an empty room. (The floor in my office is carpeted) I look around my room and it\xe2\x80\x99s not my room anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s now as large as a high school gym and empty of everything except for my desk and chair and the floor is wood. My Room looks like an empty school gym. It is then that I see my office door. It\xe2\x80\x99s glowing and the colors on it have changed from white to Lapis Blue and the handle on the door is glowing an Orange/Gold color. The door appears to be breathing in and out. On it\xe2\x80\x99s in breath the door is puffed up and show cracks with the orange/gold color in them. The door and handle are illuminated like they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to explode and catch fire. I see smoke coming in from the door jam around the door frame on its out breath. I walk slowly to the door and grab the handle. I turn it clockwise and crack the door open about an inch to peak outside my room. An intense and bright white light comes through the one inch space. It startles me because of its intense brightness and the speed at which it came through the door so close to my face. The light is just like a laser. It is focused. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like it\xe2\x80\x99s flooding the room with light it\xe2\x80\x99s like a laser beam of bright white/golden light 1 inch wide and as tall as the door. In the light are many small brown particles about the size of pencil erasers. They\xe2\x80\x99re floating and moving along in the light, going by me, not real fast as they come in the door.   Then I open the door all the way. The door opens inward and from left to right.

2350,SDE,1277,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

The spaces between my thoughts, the stillness from which all thought arises, became alive as a vibrating, pulsating energy.

2352,DEE,1111,32,,F,"Sometime during the night, I began to dream. (Highly unusual because I NEVER remember dreams although I am sure that I do dream). I was present in this dream. I knew immediately that something unusual was happening. I was wearing a long white robe and I had sandals on my feet. It was very warm. I remember thinking wow why is it so warm in a dream this is way too real. Just then I bit down and felt a grain of sand between teeth. I stopped and said to myself wait, this is important because it is real. I walked between 2 buildings made of what looked like adobe to me and I kept walking until I entered a courtyard that was of good size. There were clusters of men standing around talking with one another and they were dressed somewhat like me except they had more colorful gear on. I remember thinking that I was in Bibical days by the way they looked. In the center of the yard were a group of boys playing some kind of ball. They were chasing a ball (that was really a bunch of rags tied together). They were kicking the ball back and forth and seemed intent on playing a game. As I looked around, over to my right was a young boy about 8 to 10 years old. He had that look of dejection about him. He was leaning against the wall with his left shoulder. He was looking down and was moving the sand around with his foot. My mother instinct kicked in and I felt compassion for the boy because I knew he had not been chosen to play. I moved over behind him and that is when I reached out and touched his shoulder. He turned and looked straight into my eyes. The air literally left me and I dropped to my knees. You see, it didnt matter that he was a boy I knew him. I knew him and I began to cry. It was the Savior. Without his lips moving, transferring language to me directly to my head (but more putting it into English falls so short; it was like a thought that came to me and then blew up inside my head) but I HEARD his voice and I knew it. How do I know it? I dont know but in that moment I remember saying Oh, I know that voice! I knew that I missed him so much. I knew that I had been bought and paid for (atonement)if I chose to allow it (free agency and all). I loved him. I sensed the largness of the universe and how there was no end . . . but wait . . . he spoke Cindy, I never fit in. From that statement I understood that he didnt have to show me the cross . . . he really means he was a weird human among humans. That is all that I heard . . . everything else is as real . . . it just was that odd hearing/listening thing. Here is the significant exchange to me . . . I felt the love. It is more than love, but on Earth that is what we say. I knew it was for EVERY single human who was going to live and who had ever lived. If was like I could have reached out and picked it up . . . it had substance. And, it hurt. The love was so much that it hurt and I was humbled by what I felt. It was over. I sat straight up in my bed and looked at the clock. It was 2 a.m. For the next few weeks, the feeling didnt leave me. Sometimes I would just look at a group of students on the BSU campus and want to burst into tears because I knew how much he loved them. Then, like all things, the memory started to fade. A few months later, I got down on my knees and begged for the gift of always remembering that feeling and the event. I dont think about it every day. I am 61 now. But, I can recall it all. By the way . . . I have never wasted one more breath complaining to him about feeling out of place.

I was still shivering and all I could think about was being warm again. I was in a warming-type tube that was pumping hot air to warm me up. I have no idea of the time or how long I was drifting in and out of sleep. As I was lying there freezing &amp; shivering, I clearly remember that while my eyes were closed the light came on in the room. Instantly I was warm. I remember thinking, oh wow, I am finally warm. I was so relaxed and relieved to not be shivering. I was literally lying there basking in this warm light feeling so wonderful! At some point my logical side asked the question of who turned on the light? When I opened my eyes the entire room was filled with a brilliant light. What I remember very well was that this light although very bright, did not hurt my eyes. The light was beautiful, peaceful, pure. It is difficult to have the proper adjectives to describe this light. At some point I began looking around the room. Sitting at the foot of my bed was the figure of a man. I could not see his face as the light appeared to be radiating from behind Him. I knew without a doubt that this man was someone very important and spiritual. I felt no fear and had complete understanding at the time that I was in the presence of someone from heaven. Without speaking the way we do here on earth, He spoke to me.

An understanding of love was undeniable as it clearly is the adhesive force binding all of life.

2380,SDE,1308,41,,F,"After I fell to the ground and my father was with me we chatted like normal, then all of a sudden he said we have to go and see my step-mother and brother. The whole time I experienced this the beautiful warmth and light was upon me, to describe the light as best I can, is like having a massive spotlight place over you and the rim of the light is pure white and protective, inside the light is the perfect warmth, like the temperature is set to perfection. As we walked over to my step-mother I said to her please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know this, I then placed my hand just under her left shoulder and just above her breast and said Dad wants you to know he loves you with all his heart and soul the look on my step-mothers face was shock and tears welled in her eyes. We then walked over to my Brother (who had a 20 yr feud with my sister) I said to him again, please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know, with that I then placed my hand over his stomach, and said Dad understands the feud between he and my sister is deep seated within them and could they please let the past be and find a way to love each other again, my brother was also shocked....I told him again, not to be afraid. After I gave these messages to my family, we walked over to a rose garden, the whole time the light was with me and the most beautiful, euphoric feeling I can not describe was with me. In between the messages I kept repeating to Dad how beautiful it was. When we sat at the rose garden, Dad asked me if there was anything they could do (we werent allowed to tell him during the week he was dying) I said there wasnt the cancer had spread to most of his body and I just kept also repeating Look Dad, look how beautiful it is I was just in awe of it. With that he was gone and I was back to reality. I returned to the motel we were staying at, thinking that the experience was spurred on by lack of sleep or stress. I thought I was losing my mind. Later that day I returned to the Hospital and was in the kitchen when a nurse came in and I told her that I thought I had lost my mind and was it normal when a loved one was dying, I told her about what I had experienced and thinking she would agree that it was stress induced, the nurse (Paula) then stated that is exactly what Dad would experience when he does finally pass. I was shocked. We both returned to Dads room only to find he was awake and outside in the courtyard, with two other nurses beside him. We couldnt believe it. He was telling my brother, as best he could as for most of the week it was hard to make sense out of much he was saying to us, he told my brother he had enough and then looked straight at me and said I have had enough Im ready to go because its beautiful isnt it buttons (a nickname Dad callled me) I was shocked but replied with a smile and said It certainly is Dad. The most wonderful calm came across me and I knew then everything would be alright. Paula (the nurse) then placed her hand on my shoulder and said, There is your confirmation. Later the next day, we all couldnt believe it when my brother and sister were standing in Dads room, hugging each other and genuinely sharing a laugh together. I then softly whispered in Dads ear, See Dad, you did it, I heard you and they are getting along now, everything is ok and you can go now. I know he heard me as I felt a weak grip on my hand as I was holding his hand. A few days later I found out that the messages I had given to my step-mother and brother were almost identical to what my Dad was trying to say the morning I had the experience with my father. I wasnt in the room at the time.

2381,ME ,1212,51,,F,"Two of my dear friends and I were in a trio during the practicum of our masters program. For this exercise, I was the client, my friend was the therapist,and another friend was a neutral observer. I was determined to get answers from Steve and absolutely refused to make anything up! In a Gestalt, you invite another person (who is not physically present) to sit in a chair across from you and talk to them. When youve said whatever you want to say, you trade chairs, sitting in the guests chair and wait to see what they say back to you (through you). I told Steve about all my regrets regarding him and my mothering of him. I poured out my heart and asked his forgiveness. When I moved into (his) chair, I just waited, determined to really hear from Steve or hear nothing at all. All of a sudden I felt this huge whoosh of energy coming from the upper right and landing on me. I could sense Steves effort to reduce his energy down to match mine. He said, in great excitement, (and this sounded exactly like Steve who loved mechanical things and physics and was a dare-devil) Mom! Youll never guess what Im getting to do up here! (It was said with such excitement. It was obvious he was in heaven! Finally he quieted and said, Mom, all the things I did to hurt you and all the things you did to hurt me are just stuff that happens on earth. Now were free to just love each other.

I actually could not see these people they did not reveal themselves. I saw an outline like an aura white and thin foggy. Someone said to me telepathically come over. I hesitated scared I remember and said Im not ready. Then snap I was lying down again and opened my eyes. The room was exactly how I saw it through them closed other than the beings were gone. I felt like I knew these people intimately more than the people I know in this world even though I couldnt see them I sensed they were close to me like family like my real family. I felt I could trust them but that I hadnt completed my purposes on earth yet. I was in effect asking for more time.

2391,ADC,1377,51,,M,This is the actual text message I sent Subject: Message from Mum Hi Lone Im just awake and have just finished relaying to Sue a dream I have just finished having about an hour ago. This was unlike ANYTHING I have ever experienced in my life and I guess u may believe what Im about to say or not then thats fine. It was a message from Mum for me and us all. Ill try to describe it but the detail was as good if not better than real life. Ok this is what I was shown and told by Mum mainly. Others I saw were Dad and you. Everyone is happy and come and go busy doing exactly what they want in real life just the same. Same voices same mannerisms and smiling. As you think of some one some place or some thing it materialises and its there for you to touch use and even the smells are the same. The detail blew me away as Mum walked me from room to room by my arm and showed me that her home is still alive and well and shes home living there with all her gear pictures everything. I saw the laundry all full. I gave Mum a big kiss and she was happy to see me and have me visit. Each room was perfect right down to the wood grain on the cupboard doors and wardrobes. It was clearer than I can even remember now. I could touch and feel everything. I said can I look in the huts and I did opening the door and checking both out. The smell was the same lol. They were full of junk And I said to Mum how come and she said we keep all the extra gear in there because us kids arnt there. When I was inside the house if I concentrated real hard I could almost see the burnt walls and floors like a shadow or silhouette but Mum said to me firmly with a serious look on her face that she is NOT going to allow me to see that and it vanished. She said that our home exists in two different places at once. Its like one place is on 92fm and her place is 102fm. They share the same place or space but out of tune so u dont see the other. Anyway we had visitors come and go with cups of tea. Dad arrived in from up the farm smiling and whistling. You arrived for a visit and chat also happy and smiling. Everything coming and going as I thought of them. When I was in Mums old bedroom with the built in mirror I tried to look at myself but when I did I was like a ghost. Very faint and just a shape. And yet I could see the bloody grain in the varnished doors right beside. We went to the A&amp;P show and there were not many people there but it was on. What happens is only the people you knew and think about come through. This explains how in the spirit world its not jammed packed with every person who has passed on just your loved ones and friends coming and going like real life. Ok back home again and Muns really young and beautiful probably in her twenties. See they can appear as any age they want. I knew it was mum. I swung her around then she fell over a chair laughing. I had tea with Mum and now the afternoon was getting darker it was time for me to go. I have her a big hug and began to cry with joy. I knew I was experiencing a dream but it was much too real for just a memory and I could ask questions. I thought I would wake Sue with my crying but I went back to Mum. She smiled and said she is happy and well and not to fear. I asked her if I could come and visit her again but she got serious again and said no but she will think about it. I said how about once a week and I begged her but she smiled and said maybe. Oh well I thought. I walked out the gate and some guys standing on the driveway who looked like Eddie yates. He was wearing a parka and there was a farm implement behind him. I said to him who are you ? and he told me his name. Random spirits appear too and he was out the gate and seemed to be waiting for Dad to come out to see him. I hopped into my car yes u can drive in the afterlife but its cool . You dont have miles of boring nothingness. Next second Im on my way home to Hokitika and I stop in a town. I got out at a park and some guys sitting there in his car with his mouth wide open looking at me. I said what are u looking at ? He says you are bloody flying and floating up in the air. I said so ... You can too come on up so he hops out and flies up to me. He was hopeless and tumbled over. I laughed. Then I awoke in bed at home with tears running down my cheeks and so bloody happy I had to wake Sue and relay this story. It was not a dream but was a real experience. It was like a near death experience without the death. I could see anything I wanted and ask questions at will. I feel a lot more content about home and Mum and I have been shown a glimpse of heaven. It was SOOO nice I can see why Mum is restricting my return. If u stay and dont go back you die and its not my time. But we are allowed to visit but only when our loved ones allow us. I hope this makes sense and I was pleased to see you there too,,New Zeala,1 2000,religious,religious,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,week,very strong,very st,"50,000 99",High,Vehicle,,marri,marri,Yes,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

A kind of birds eye view was shown to me and a thick blanket of love was pulled over that area which was taken by IS. It became clear to me that this blanket of love was made by numerous souls who were concerned and sending their love. This love was enormous and the concern was like from a mother towards her children. It became clear to me that the love was there and it could heal if people wanted to.

2406,DEE,1420,15,,M,"On the third day in the hospital, the day I had planned to end my life, I spent the only night of my treatment without a roommate. In hindsight, however, I know that I was not alone that evening. During a period of intense reflection, I decided to open the Bible that was provided in each room. I casually flipped through the pages and eventually turned to the back cover where someone had scribbled a few of their favorite verses, one of which was Ecclesiastes 7:17. I immediately located chapter 7 / verse 17 in the very top right corner of the page, next to the page number of 717, where the number 717 was scratched in pen directly above the page number. I was strangely comforted and terrified simultaneously as I read the words, \xe2\x80\x9cBe not over much wicked; neither be thou foolish. Why shouldest thou die before thy time.\xe2\x80\x9d The rest of the chapter proceeds to advise the reader against submitting to the extremes of both righteousness and wickness, foolishness and wisdom, and purity and profane. Ill always have a physical monument of this miraculous affirmation of Gods love for me because, like the heathen I am, I took advantage of my lone solitary evening in the hospitial to secretly remove the passage which I carry on my person to this day.  Though I did not realize it until ten years after the fact, this was a covenent with God that was initiated before I ever even entered the hospital. Shortly before I plotted my suicide and entered the hospital, I had carved a cross into my chest and filled it with black ink as I selfishly pleaded with God to end my girlfriends unintended pregnancy. At the age of fifteen, my shortsighted naivity deluded my judgment into thinking this child would mark the end of my existence. Shortly thereafter, my girlfriend miscarried an innocent life whose destiny was not its own. I had desperately pleaded with God to change the course of my life and received more than I bargained for when, to my surprise, our covenent was sealed during that third evening in that hospital. The undoubted reason that God used the trifect appearance of 717 to get my attention is because 717 indicates the month and day of my birth on July 17, 1987. It was through this miracle that God sealed our first covenant with the symbol of 717. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a wealth of revelations that have continued to unfold through the present day.

2407,NDE,1117,30,,M,"I was walking along a road. It was not paved, but a gravel path, very nicely maintained with beautiful flowers along the sides. The road started in a valley and went up a hill towards a very beautiful mansion or palace with a gate in front of it. It was far off in the distance from where I began to walk, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say how far exactly. On either side of the road, the land sloped away sharply, like going off a cliff, so if one fell off the road, one would land in a deep, dark pit. From the pit one could hear sounds of agony, wailing, and lamenting from human beings who were down there. Some tried to claw their way up and grab at me on the road, but I knew they could not actually reach me. I was a little afraid at first, as I knew this to be the pit of hell. The road was not narrow, however, so there was no danger of me falling off the road. I began walking towards the gate, all the while the lost souls wailing until I got near to the gate. Close to the gate, they were no longer around. The mansion was very beautiful. The whole environment was other-worldly, somehow glittering and radiant. I knew I was on another plane, no longer on Earth. I could hear the gentle music of stringed instruments in the background, very soothing and lovely. Eventually I started nearing the gate of the mansion or palace. The mansion was actually quite far from the gate, but one could see radiant beings behind the gate going about their daily activities. Some were carrying baskets with flowers and all were going about their daily routine. There was complete unity and love there, unlike the way people on Earth behave. It was serene and peaceful, just a wonderful place, and I really wanted so much to go inside. There were four winged angels guarding the gate on the outside, two on each side, and as I approached, they moved together and crossed their arms, blocking my entry. They were radiant beings, clearly not human. They were so very kind, but were not going to let me in, although they did not say anything to that effect. There was so much joy and peace there, I tried to get by them, when a group of beings from inside approached the gate to talk to me. An elderly \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d (not a human being) with white hair spoke to me. Although he was right in front of me, his voice sounded like he was very, very far away. It was almost like I was hearing an echo of something said in the distance. He said I would be there at a point in time, but not yet, that my mission was incomplete and that I still had a lot more to accomplish. He was very kind and spoke gently to me, absolutely convincing me that I could not get in. Until this moment, I had really not thought about anything relating to my earthly life, although I knew who I was. I was dressed as I was the day of the accident. When he told me that I could not enter, only then did I start to try to think about what had really happened to me and what was going on. I thought it odd that I was the only person around and there were no dogs or other animals. As I was considering all this, I left that place. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I actually regained consciousness at that precise moment, but I suspect I did. I did not recognize any people whom I knew previously who had died. I also did not know any of the people in the pit.

2408,ADC,1172,54,,F,"While drifting off to sleep, a man appeared at the foot of my bed, dressed in an old uniform, which I later discovered was an army uniform, and he was smiling and looked happy. He obviously wanted me to see him, as he just stood there, and I said, What are you doing here? And I was totally calm, not scared at all, and then he faded away. My husband in the next room heard what I had said and shouted back, What? And I answered, oh, nothing and I knew that something significant had happened, but didnt know for sure what. The next day, I asked my mother and sister if my Uncle Dan had ever served in the army, and the answer was yes. I really believe that Dan appeared to me because I am receptive to these kinds of experiences, and because he wanted my mother to know that he was o.k., in his young body, and no longer afflicted by the physical problems he had before he died. I thought then that the real purpose of his visit was so that my mother could tell his wife, who still survived, that he was o.k. My mother never did tell her, as she was not a believer of these kinds of things. My mother passed away recently, and Dans daughter, my cousin, sent me a card that stated that her dad adored my mother, his little sister. I now know that purpose of his visit was not so that his wife would know that he was o.k., but so that his sister, whom he adored, would know that he was o.k.

Once alert, I noticed an older truck in my direct view. It was an odd, faded color of purple. As the color caught my attention, the truck hummed to life. A man had started the motor and was backing up.  Behind the truck, sitting in the driveway playing, was a small child aged 2-3. Horrified, I watched as the truck backed over the little child. Intuitively I knew it was the boys father who had unknowingly run over, and killed the child.  Immediately the infant boys essense popped out of his body. There was a translucent quality to it, but for me it was more of a strong sensing of his presence. He was bewildered, and unsure of what to do. Disoriented.  Having had an NDE some seven years prior, I knew that I was there to lead this little one to the Light. I mentally asked him if I could help, and he agrred.

2415,SDE,1277,62,,F,"I was attending a morning funeral of my Bible Study leader, a very kind man named David C., on Saturday, March 15, 2008 at the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York. The large church was packed, as David was much beloved. He was a top executive at Citibank and many co-workers were there. David was a fairly young man at 50 when he passed suddenly of a massive heart attack while he was working out before work at his local gym. While sitting in the church listening to Davids eulogies, his beloved friend and pastor (forgot his name) got up to speak at the front of the church, with Davids coffin near him. I suddenly looked up and midway between the peoples heads and the high ceiling, I saw something that looked different. It was air. Normally, you do not see air but I saw an oval-shaped, contained body of wavy air about 6-7 feet long, hovering near the front of the church where the people were sitting. The wavy air didnt move from its position. It didnt go up or down or right or left. I didnt hear anything, taste anything or touch anything while looking at this image. I just saw it. I didnt feel anything in particular. I just stared at it, without feeling, which is how I usually react when Im witnessing a miracle or something spiritual from God. At some point I stopped looking at it, probably when the funeral was over. In the next day or two I thought about the contained body of wavy air and then I knew that was Davids spirit or soul watching his own funeral, wanting to be there with his beloved wife, sons, family, friends and co-workers. I sent an email to everyone I knew at the funeral to tell them that Davids soul was present with us at his funeral. I hand wrote a note to Davids widow, Cathy, to tell her that David was with her and their sons at his funeral. No one responded to my mail. What the viewing of the wavy air told me was that the Soul and/or Spirit is real. I saw it with my own eyes. Also, that we humans dont really die, we pass on. Yes, our bodies die but our souls are then released and return back into Eternity with God. I like to tell as many people as I can the comforting news that we dont really die, we pass on. And that the Soul, Spirit is real and returns to God when we pass. Some people express comfort to me when I tell them. Some people just stare at me. I feel my job is to just tell people the good news of what I experience spiritually. Whether they believe me or not is up to them. I dont try to convince them that what Im saying is true. I just tell them for them to do with whatever they like.

They were two shadows, one in the shape of a butterfly and one in the shape of a dove. They were quite detailed. The butterfly, for example, had the veins in its wings prominently outlined as if it were made of stained glass- but it was a shadow, in black and white. The dove also appeared to resemble an image you might see on stained glass, only black and white. I sat up further and spoke out loud to myself: I am awake. This is real. What I am seeing is real... Then, the butterflys wings began to move and it flew up the wall and to the ceiling, where it disappeared. Next, the doves wings began to flutter, and it also moved up toward the ceiling and disappeared.

I forced myself to look to the left to try to ascertain where I was. In between the aperture blades I could see I was in outer space. I saw a black sky all around with stars. When I turned to move forward again I could see in the distance what appeared to be the end of the tunnel. It was made up of a beige inflatable cushion-type structure.

I reassured him there was no need for concern as the radiation wasnt bothering me at all and the DCIS was not ever fatal. He told me he was very proud of me. After a time, He asked me to come around the table to where he was sitting so I could give him a hug goodbye. As I did, he asked me to forgive him. The encounter was pleasant up to that point. When he asked me to forgive him, all my memories of how he had been a strict disciplinarian came back to me and I started to feel badly, reliving those feelings I had as a child and teenager.

I could write my own book about all the signs John gave me and my family after his death. He loved us so much his love transcended death and the tragedy of his loss made it that much more important that he get through to us and let us know he was okay.

As I was getting ready to go to bed, the light was on in my room, and in the outside hallway. My husband was standing on the other side of the bed, and I was planning my day in my head about which florist I would buy the flowers from. Out of the blue- and this is very difficult to describe-there was a presence that looked like the jet stream that comes from a squid. It looked powdery, or liquid, or smokey and was black, and it shot past the door, which had reflected light on it from the hallway. At the very same instant, a voice said to me, you need to let go, your mother is going to die tonight. I was stunned and turned around and put my hands to my face. What was most amazing was the authority that I could hear, but there was no audible voice. The command and presence of this visitor inspired my respect, but I felt its compassion. I tried to understand if it was male or female, and have often thought it might be male, but young. The next morning at 7:00, the board and care contacted me. My mom had died during the night.

2432,DEE,1251,40,,F,"My experience happened approximately 2 weeks after Sept 11, 2001. I had been meditating in bed and felt myself drift off. My now ex-husband was sleeping next to me. Suddenly there was a bright light surrounding me. I could not see anything but gold light. The brightness of the light began to dim so I could open my eyes. When I did, there was a beautiful Michael Angelo angel with me. It was very large, probably a good 7 feet with huge wings and a face that was so serene. It was the most beautiful face Ive seen. And filled with such kindness. I felt like I was in a huge warm wave because the vibration surrounding me was like being rocked by a gentle tide while lying in a boat. It was beyond comforting. The angle knew that I was very upset about the direction of humanity after 911 and told me, not with spoken words, but with telepathic words, that everything would be ok and that I needed to keep reminding people what brought us to that point. I needed to speak of bring love and not focus on hate or enemies. The angel told me it knew I felt very alone but to remember that I was not and that I should keep putting out the message of love. It touched my face and then it slowly vanished. I was sitting up in my bed and tears were streaming down my face and I cant even describe how I felt because there are no words...but I was the most comforted I had ever been in my life and felt like I belonged to God and the universe.

2440,DEE,1124,47,,M,"Testimony on God\xe2\x80\x99s Power As revealed to Conrad February 5, 2007, 6:25AM to 9:25AM Introduction My name is Conrad; I was born in the Philippines and was raised in a Roman Catholic family. I was an altar boy during my Catechism years. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the bible twice from cover to cover when I was young and every time I get to the crucifixion part, I cried. Some parts of the bible I would easily understand, but I also got confused in others. As I grew up a verse from the bible kept playing in my mind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which part of the bible it came from but it went like this \xe2\x80\x9cSeek ye first the Kingdom of God \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d and that is what I did. I went about seeking the Kingdom of God, read many books of different titles and pretty soon I discovered the wonders of Science and how it can reasonably explain things that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. The more science books I read the more convinced I was that things that were once mysterious can be scientifically explained and verified. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed in proving things undoubtedly before I believed it and accepted it. I only wanted to believe in known and proven facts.  And so I went through College and read even more books and gained more knowledge. I excelled in class but not good enough to have any honors because of my laziness and procrastination. You see, I would do well in exams, in fact I\xe2\x80\x99d be top in exams but not accomplish my homework or lab works so I also had grades that were just average. As my learning progressed I discovered that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need God to have a life or to live my life. I believed this with conviction and even had a theory that men created God and not the other way around. I wrote a thesis on how during the early stages of evolution men might have created God because there were many things they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand or were unable to explain. They attributed those things to an all knowing creator and consequently created a God. A friend of mine presented it as an English class project and almost got kicked out by the instructor. (That\xe2\x80\x99s how blasphemous it appeared but when you think deeper you can discern that men if left alone will instinctively seek God. We are the only creation that actively seek and try to understand our origins.) I went on with my life for years not believing or needing God until I got married to my wife Elisa in 1986 when we were both working in the Middle East. Our marriage did not give a child for almost five years. We went to see doctors and specialists in hospitals and clinics but we were unsuccessful. A surgery for me and standard medical procedures done for my wife did not result in conception. I desperately wanted a child and I would do anything to have one. I started wondering \xe2\x80\x9cAm I being punished for not believing in God?\xe2\x80\x9d Despite all these disappointments, we continued seeing fertility specialists. We also had Artificial Insemination in the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines. In December 1989, we went back to the Philippines for a much needed month long vacation. And one Sabbath day in January 1990, at the Manila Center (an SDA church in Manila, Philippines), a pastor from California was leading a service and he had a sermon about the earth being like a washing machine for dirty souls. He said \xe2\x80\x9cThe Earth is used by God to wash and clean souls to make them fit to go to heaven and live with God.\xe2\x80\x9d It opened my mind and I understood then why I needed God in my life. I wept and cried uncontrollably. It caught the Pastor\xe2\x80\x99s attention and I guess he pitied my poor soul so much that he gave me his Bible and even signed it. That night I prayed hard, a really sincere prayer to God and I asked Him to give me a child. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d I prayed \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a real God, and really powerful God, give me a child and I will convert to the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\xe2\x80\x9d Back to the UAE on February 1990, my wife tested positive for pregnancy and in November 29, 1990, our daughter Ari was born. I thought about my promise to God and the implications of that promise. My parents and siblings, my Catholic friends would hate me I thought, I would miss food that I grew accustomed to eating. I cringed at these possibilities and so I kept living my life the way I wanted and I justified my actions with some semi-scientific reasoning to deny God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing of a daughter for my wife and me. Fast forward to 2007, we have since moved to the US, we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in Boca Raton, Florida, New Orleans, LA and presently, The Woodlands, TX. I have long stopped attending regular church services but I have reluctantly attended worship services at the SDA church.

2442,ADC,1172,54,,F,"While drifting off to sleep, a man appeared at the foot of my bed, dressed in an old uniform, which I later discovered was an army uniform, and he was smiling and looked happy. He obviously wanted me to see him, as he just stood there, and I said, What are you doing here? And I was totally calm, not scared at all, and then he faded away. My husband in the next room heard what I had said and shouted back, What? And I answered, oh, nothing and I knew that something significant had happened, but didnt know for sure what. The next day, I asked my mother and sister if my Uncle Dan had ever served in the army, and the answer was yes. I really believe that Dan appeared to me because I am receptive to these kinds of experiences, and because he wanted my mother to know that he was o.k., in his young body, and no longer afflicted by the physical problems he had before he died. I thought then that the real purpose of his visit was so that my mother could tell his wife, who still survived, that he was o.k. My mother never did tell her, as she was not a believer of these kinds of things. My mother passed away recently, and Dans daughter, my cousin, sent me a card that stated that her dad adored my mother, his little sister. I now know that purpose of his visit was not so that his wife would know that he was o.k., but so that his sister, whom he adored, would know that he was o.k.

2443,ADC,1153,44,,F,"My best friend passed into Spirit on May 15, 2004 at the age of 45, after a 10 year battle with HER-2 Breast Cancer. We had spent 40 years weaving the fabric of our lives together in a dance that was just magical. Ours is a long story of love and friendship. It is hard to relay in a few words the significance of this miracle,but I will try.  Two years ago Karen started having massive headaches and was feeling weird. We were headed off to a healing weekend in New York State and having a grand time. It was just the two of us tooling around in the car and laughing and enjoying each others company. At one point, she became very serious and told me she thought her chemotherapy may be causing these symptoms. She was struggling as to whether or not to go off the chemo and just let God do His work. I told her this was a huge decision and one not to be taken lightly. I am a big believer in asking God to give us a sign when we need an answer to an important or not so important question. Because this was a VERY important question, I told her she needed to ask for a sign that would be unquestionable! Something so unusual that it could only be from God. I then said, How about if we see a green donkey? Then you can go off chemotherapy. She giggled and said, That sounds great. The rest of the weekend we searched for a green donkey. We found yellow pigs, purple cows, red dogs and even a green horse.How we tried to rationalize that a horse is almost a donkey. But we knew it had to be a Green Donkey. We even spent the next afternoon in Woodstock, NY going through every store but never found a green donkey. A week later the headaches continued and she went for an MRI. Her father also passed away from Alzheimers this same week. On the morning of his funeral, she received a phone call from her oncologist telling her the cancer had spread to her brain. She went through the whole day, a huge funeral, and never told a soul except her husband what she had found out that morning. She had courage beyond human strength. She made it through brain surgery and massive radiation and lived two more years. She passed on May 15, 2004 surrounded by her whole family. What follows is what I said at her memorial service (which 700 people attended). Notice the part about the green donkey toward the end. I have had the pleasure of knowing Karen for over 40 years and calling her one of my best and dearest friends. But I know I am just one of countless best friends that Karen had...there was something about her that just made you want to be close to her and know her better. To Karens family...she was a mom, a wife, a sister, a daughter, and a cousin, but for the vast majority of us here today, she was our friend. A friend of the truest sense and one that was there for each of us no matter what was going on in her life. Remarkable, selfless, trustworthy, sincere, kind, compassionate, spiritual, and beautiful are words that can only begin to describe Karen. Besides being a friend,Karen was a teacher. She taught me more about strength and courage than I ever wanted to know. When my son deployed to Afghanistan last Oct, she came to me one day like an angel sent from God. She held me, cried with me and instilled in me The Power of Now. This gave me strength that I did not know I had. If I can take one tenth of her strength and live the rest of my life, then I will be happy. I will miss her human presence more than I can even imagine at this time... her spirit while she was on this Earth was immeasurable. What I look forward to from this day on is how she will guide, love, and watch over each of us in her new found strength in SPIRIT. And so I say to you my dear Karen, Godspeed to you on this new journey you have undertaken. I know Daddy was holding your green donkey and that now you know all the Divine Order that is so hard for us to understand here on Earth. I giggle at the thought of our next life together and I ask you Sister Karen to hold down the abbey until I get there. When I returned home from her service that evening, there was a message on my answering machine from my son, who was in Afghanistan, serving in the US Army. He had never, ever called on a weeknight since he had deployed, until that night. This in and of itself spoke volumes to me. I was sad I had missed his call, but I knew he was OK and surely sending me some love from afar, even though he did not know of Karens death yet. Karen had given me extreme comfort and support while she was alive in regards to his deployment and no matter what was going on in her life, she always asked how my son was doing. That same night, the phone rang again around 2:30 AM and it was my son. What a joy to hear his voice! We spoke for about 20 minutes and during the conversation he mentioned that his best buddy and teammate had put new pictures up on a website ",,Citizen,1 2000,spiritual,spiritual,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,seldom,very strong,moder,"0 24,999",colle,At the,,single,single,No,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

2452,ADC,1290,62,,F,"On January 4, 2007, I was alone in the kitchen of my home in Ossining, NY. My husband was upstairs working. I like my home orderly and keep everything in its place. It was daytime and I was preparing some food when my eye caught an object by the floor. I looked down and saw a little white square paper wedged up against the dark green backsplash runner by the floor. I picked up the paper. It was actually an empty little envelope with a gold lining inside. The envelope looked like it was opened after it was sealed because it had a rip in the flap. It was the kind of gift envelope that contained a card with someones name on it that youd give with a gift at Christmas. On the front of the envelope was the hand-printed word Dad. It looked like my handwriting but I didnt remember giving my father this envelope in the 2 1/2 years we were communicating just before his passing, and we didnt talk to each other for 29 years previously. In my home, a random and obscure object just doesnt turn up mysteriously in a strange place like that. I stood there with a shocked feeling, staring at the envelope. I thought I knew it came from a spiritual source but I wasnt ready to accept that. I had to rule out all possibilities. I called for Hank to come down and showed him the envelope. I asked if it was his. He said no. I asked if he ever saw this before. No. Could he imagine where it came from? No. I asked if it fell out of the newspapers he recycles in the kitchen. He said no. I told him where I found it and that it came from Holy Spirit. Hank became agitated and got a little angry. He was annoyed that mysterious, spiritual things like this were happening to me and darted back upstairs to his office. I stood there looking at the envelope and asked out loud: Dad, are you here with me now? Suddenly, a brisk wind came across my bare shins and I felt the chills. Then I knew my father was with me. I wanted to know more about this mystery, so I called a cousin of Hanks who was a Deacon at a Catholic Church in New Orleans. I asked Gary what all this meant. He said that God made my father my Guardian Angel and that my father would be watching over me. This was awesome. Although I had had a love/hate relationship with my father, I just loved him now and was happy to know he was with me. I have fond, loving memories bonding with my father in my childhood and enjoying life with him. (Im uploading a photo of this envelope.

I was flying through the air with my Mom and another unseen presence was also along with us as we were flying over what seemed to be Utopia--a lush, green landscape, over waterfalls and tropical flowers--it was so breathtaking it overwhelmed my visual senses. More importantly is what we both seemed to be feeling during this extreme adventure--indescribable joy, wonder, happiness, laughter, totally carefree and with pure love totally surrounding us. After I awoke and recalled the dream in vivid detail I came to the conclusion that the unseen presence I experienced was God. This dream continues to comfort and reassure me that even though I would learn bad news the next day--my Mom did pass 18 months later-- I have a very special and believable preview of being reunited with her in heaven.

2456,DEE,1251,40,,F,"My experience happened approximately 2 weeks after Sept 11, 2001. I had been meditating in bed and felt myself drift off. My now ex-husband was sleeping next to me. Suddenly there was a bright light surrounding me. I could not see anything but gold light. The brightness of the light began to dim so I could open my eyes. When I did, there was a beautiful Michael Angelo angel with me. It was very large, probably a good 7 feet with huge wings and a face that was so serene. It was the most beautiful face Ive seen. And filled with such kindness. I felt like I was in a huge warm wave because the vibration surrounding me was like being rocked by a gentle tide while lying in a boat. It was beyond comforting. The angle knew that I was very upset about the direction of humanity after 911 and told me, not with spoken words, but with telepathic words, that everything would be ok and that I needed to keep reminding people what brought us to that point. I needed to speak of bring love and not focus on hate or enemies. The angel told me it knew I felt very alone but to remember that I was not and that I should keep putting out the message of love. It touched my face and then it slowly vanished. I was sitting up in my bed and tears were streaming down my face and I cant even describe how I felt because there are no words...but I was the most comforted I had ever been in my life and felt like I belonged to God and the universe.

2457,ADC,1363,25,,F,"I sat on the edge of the bed as Shawn tried to comfort me, my crying seemed to intensify with the downpour of the rain. I looked up at the ceiling in our bedroom asking God for a sign. I asked him as a Catholic, saying out loud: I have faith and I know they say he is in a better place, but I need MORE! I need PROOF that he is OKAY! And just as I shouted this at God a sudden loud bang and flash of white light filled the bedroom. Shawn and I physically jumped out of bed because the crash was so loud we thought the window was going to crash in on us. We looked at each other, puzzled. Was that for us? Because the timing was just as if God was answering my prayer. Just as that happened we began to calm down and the rain also subsided. I told Shawn that it felt like an answer from God and it was so strange. The next morning Shawn went out to our car that was parked on the street. He heard muffled music playing that grew louder as he got nearer. When he opened the car door the radio was blasting music very loud on my brothers favourite radio station. When Shawn tried to shut the radio off, it would not turn off, he had to pull the system out of its dock to make it turn off. The radio remained like that for years. The wires were fried because that night our building and our car was hit by lightening, the very lightening that crashed outside our window at the very moment I asked God for a sign / for proof that John was okay. That isnt the end of it. From then on it was like the floodgates had opened. I got all kinds of signs from John, all kinds of instances of after-death communication, including a full apparition, physical phenomenon, electronic phenomenon and I would like to share that all here. I could write my own book about all the signs John gave me and my family after his death. He loved us so much his love transcended death and the tragedy of his loss made it that much more important that he get through to us and let us know he was okay.

The atmosphere in the room began slowly to change, it began to thicken and become more dense and there was an overwhelming presence in the room and the atmosphere.

It was absolute unconditional love and a clear message came into my head that love is the essential truth.

2460,ME ,1451,24,,M,"Detail may take a bit more space than there is here, but I will attempt. Briefly, very tired, I fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed like the beginning of a dream sequence, I found myself on the second floor of a mansion in town that I was quite personally familiar with. From a spot in the hall, I noticed flashing lights coming from the hallway of the west wing. Irritated and needing to investigate I went in their direction. Where the halls joined at a right angle, still more lights and, of all people, my great aunt staring into the lights at the end of the hall. Very agitated at this occurence, not knowing if it was fire, or some other upset that required my attention, I began a trot in its direction. At that point I recall (kind of like Santas reindeer!) a lifting of my feet and legs and up I went. In very short order all went dark, all fell away (my body, place, circumstances)and the essential me of me was involved in an ascent...until coming to said portal mentioned earlier in which all I can recall were cloudlike formations over a cauldronlike (and that word is not to have any negative connotation) basis...with what was bubbling up from the cauldron mixing in with the clouds above it and this was perfection and creation in action. My KNOWING at that time was that I was in everything, everything was in me, and that everything was in a perfect balance. The other notion I had was that the energy was so powerful that if it were withdrawn everything would collapse, but that that would not happen...furthermore, the word calibrated came to mind. As in, everything was perfectly calibrated to hold only its allotment of that energy, and that one-zillionth more of it and a body would burst into bits. At the portals edge, even though I had no body or even much in the way of caring about what had happened to it, I do recall my hands grabbing the portals edge and I kind of docked there and went no further...only witnessed the roiling of the generator of all that is, was and would be (as described before.) At about the point of docking and peering in, I was conscious, alert, awake and aware, and said to myself: OMG, Im dying! and then something to the effect of I didnt want to do that. (That would be the distressing part and I almost clicked another choice for 42.) As soon as I said that the experience of coming down began, the up there having been short-circuited by my ambivalence or fear...even as I quick-changed my mind and said, No, NO! (leave me up here for a while longer.) The coming down was not so memorable in and of itself. What there is to know is that I did then and still do sleep on my back...and I felt as if my feet were the first to gain life back and then the descent of the rest back down as if my astral back to stomach and like that. As my arms were folded across my chest, they were the last to come to and I recall being conscious of that happening. Upon full re-entry I was quite astonished at the whole thing and lept out of bed as if every cell was on fire and said Holy S**t, Theres nothing I cant do! Later on I went at myself over that notion-thinking that it was a bit egocentric, but I digress. I further recall that everything in the room had a bit of a glow to it, and so probably did I. I also remember being fascinated at a pencil in my room. Its interiority struck me as magnificent...and to think that none of it (me, my body, material circumstances) had mattered or even existed just moments before was quite startling.

2466,NDE,1398,32,,F,"I remember a feeling of being sucked out of my body, sort of like separating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with all the stickiness and resistance. After I was completely separated I was observing from above as they were performing CPR and attaining IV access. The doctor put my body in Trudelenburg position. At this point, my attention is drawn away by a feeling that someone was calling me. My attention became focused on this sparkling light, I want to call it a warm glowing light but it is hard to describe because the physical sensation of warmth was not really present. As soon as I acknowledged this light, I was just in it. There were these rainbow orbs that spoke to me and there were people there in what I was communicated to be a sort of holding room. I didnt see anything other than people and orbs in this room that went on for what seemed like an eternity without walls or ceiling. Soon after, I remember laughing but not laughing like in a physical sense, but, in any case, laughing with the people in the room. It was like I ran into old friends and we just picked right back where we left off type of feeling. I dont really have a sense of time of how long I was there but I was guided to another location and there was a woman there who said that I was going to be experiencing what I termed a rewrite. This is so hard to put into words but she communicated to me that a different course was available to me if I so chose to follow it. I felt like everything was more real than anything I had ever experienced, so alive, so intelligent, so revealed. The woman was near a mountain, at the base of it in a vivacious green meadow. We sat for a while but I cannot put into words the things I learned, I dont even remember what I had learned until I come across events in my life that trigger the knowledge that was given to me. I know it sounds strange but it makes sense to me. I was given a choice. You can stay or you can go back. I remember asking questions, like, go back where? And as soon as I asked that question, I knew where. I dont think the complete question even came forth before the answer was already being revealed. This is when I could hear conversations going on. I could hear the people in my ICU room. Complete conversations. I became saddened and wanted to see but I was informed that I had to choose first. I heard my son crying, begging me to open my eyes. My attention went to the woman, her eyes were crystal clear pale blue eyes and she had long dark hair, dressed in a sort of plain creamy colored garb. She never spoke sound words, it was telepathic thoughts. She revealed different life traumas I had experienced up to that point; I was wondering why only the traumas and not the good times, and just as I had that thought the answer was that it serves a purpose and that purpose comes to me at different times since my near death. I also heard my mothers prayers and the prayers of others pleading for my health and wellness. I recall leaving the woman in the field and I just seemed to float away...into space...and it felt as if though I had rushed millions maybe even billions of miles away in seconds. I seen these other worlds and other peoples only to be drawn back in a flash to the holding room. It was time for me to decide and it seemed urgent; will I accept the rewrite or stay where I was; there was no right or wrong choice. Only my choice. I longed for my children, knowing that things would be very different in a bad way if I chose to stay. I was communicated that my road to recovery would be hard at first, but would get easier as time went by. It was hard for me to conceive how this time would be if I returned. I felt drawn back and chose to go back all the while knowing it was going to be difficult. As soon as I made the choice, the people in the holding room became ecstatic and exuberant and I thought this was the strangest occurrence of the whole ordeal. I all of a sudden felt the most unbearable discomfort, my body. I tried to open my eyes and couldnt, I felt the loudness of my heart beating at an unthinkable speed, I immediately came back out of my body and hovered over it for a moment before entering again. The next thing I remember is the nurses and doctor in the ICU room asking me to stay calm because I was connected to a ventilator. My hands were secured to restraints. I couldnt focus my eyes when I first came back, I had been in a coma for 9 days. I had apparently became septic after surgery and went into septic shock. On entering the ICU on July 1, 2002, I slipped into a coma, they intubated me, and there I lay dying until July 9th, my daughters birthday. A few hours had passed and I kept seeing people that the nurses said were not there and experiencing odd things like seeing fish swimming in the air.

2478,DEE,1111,32,,F,"Sometime during the night, I began to dream. (Highly unusual because I NEVER remember dreams although I am sure that I do dream). I was present in this dream. I knew immediately that something unusual was happening. I was wearing a long white robe and I had sandals on my feet. It was very warm. I remember thinking wow why is it so warm in a dream this is way too real. Just then I bit down and felt a grain of sand between teeth. I stopped and said to myself wait, this is important because it is real. I walked between 2 buildings made of what looked like adobe to me and I kept walking until I entered a courtyard that was of good size. There were clusters of men standing around talking with one another and they were dressed somewhat like me except they had more colorful gear on. I remember thinking that I was in Bibical days by the way they looked. In the center of the yard were a group of boys playing some kind of ball. They were chasing a ball (that was really a bunch of rags tied together). They were kicking the ball back and forth and seemed intent on playing a game. As I looked around, over to my right was a young boy about 8 to 10 years old. He had that look of dejection about him. He was leaning against the wall with his left shoulder. He was looking down and was moving the sand around with his foot. My mother instinct kicked in and I felt compassion for the boy because I knew he had not been chosen to play. I moved over behind him and that is when I reached out and touched his shoulder. He turned and looked straight into my eyes. The air literally left me and I dropped to my knees. You see, it didnt matter that he was a boy I knew him. I knew him and I began to cry. It was the Savior. Without his lips moving, transferring language to me directly to my head (but more putting it into English falls so short; it was like a thought that came to me and then blew up inside my head) but I HEARD his voice and I knew it. How do I know it? I dont know but in that moment I remember saying Oh, I know that voice! I knew that I missed him so much. I knew that I had been bought and paid for (atonement)if I chose to allow it (free agency and all). I loved him. I sensed the largness of the universe and how there was no end . . . but wait . . . he spoke Cindy, I never fit in. From that statement I understood that he didnt have to show me the cross . . . he really means he was a weird human among humans. That is all that I heard . . . everything else is as real . . . it just was that odd hearing/listening thing. Here is the significant exchange to me . . . I felt the love.

If was like I could have reached out and picked it up . . . it had substance. And, it hurt. The love was so much that it hurt and I was humbled by what I felt. It was over. I sat straight up in my bed and looked at the clock. It was 2 a.m. For the next few weeks, the feeling didnt leave me. Sometimes I would just look at a group of students on the BSU campus and want to burst into tears because I knew how much he loved them. Then, like all things, the memory started to fade. A few months later, I got down on my knees and begged for the gift of always remembering that feeling and the event. I dont think about it every day. I am 61 now. But, I can recall it all.

2482,DEE,1541,65,,M,"My STE is a Divine Entity Encounter, at least I think that is the closest description of it. I have reported this in my book; Jesus Who. I suspect it was the Spirit of God, but it could have been an angle.  Personal Story; A love tap of Understanding For several years, I could not accept that all the people in a couple of Old Testament cities were killed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s army. Joshua 11:11-12 What about the infants and young children? Why should they die a terrible death for the sins of their parents? I was thrown a curve by this story. How could God do such a terrible thing? This was not merciful. This was a big problem for me and remained so for years. These young children could have been taken into homes of decent people and they would have no knowledge of their biological parents or their old lifestyles. Then one day I was praying about this and I got something like a gentle slap on the head, an interruption of my consciousness from outside myself, likely from the Spirit of God; I clearly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe souls of the innocents were taken a moment before they died.\xe2\x80\x9d So when the sword hit, the children were in a persistent vegetative state in that God had already taken their souls to safety. What a relief! I was elated. Then about five seconds later, I thought; Hey, wait a minute. Did God really tell me that, or did I just make it up to ease my own distress? Straight away I got a second interruption and I clearly heard that voice again; \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did make it up, how much wiser and more merciful is your Father in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wow! It was definitely not my voice or my words. The old fashioned style is not the way I use words or language! Plus the fact that it came as an interruption to my thoughts (hey, pay attention). I am convinced that it was Divinely given personal information to help me get over this stumbling block. Most wonderful of all, notice that the communication was loving, not angry. I had just assumed, that God would be angry with me for being dumb, weak and sinful, because I was often angry with myself for those reasons. The improbable lovingness and civility of this communication kept me in a state of astonishment for several years and still causes breathlessness when I recall it to mind. How could the all powerful God love such a dumb, weak and sinful little man? Is that an improbable enough God for you? It sure is for me and I do have faith in Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got you, He\xe2\x80\x99s got you and He\xe2\x80\x99s got your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything because all this earthly stuff, everything here, is ridiculously trivial to Him. I thank God for showing Himself to me as a loving father and I do feel very blessed for it. God is love and I suspect that humans have been programmed by God to love our children so that we, in our human pettiness, would have at least some experience of what love is. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister\xe2\x80\x9d. 1 John 4:21 So we are supposed to love one another, that means love everyone always. So just know that you too may reasonably expect that the one and only God will communicate with you about your Christian concerns and that it will come out of the clear blue sky and be a loving personal answer. He is the same loving God for all of us, even those people we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for. As improbable as it is, God loves us all. You will come to be as fond of your new Christian memories as you are of your actual childhood memories, because there is a mighty and loving Father helping you through a difficult and confusing adolescents. If you missed out on that from your biological father, you will find your Heavenly Father especially wonderful and loving. Really. God never said that the Bible is all there is to know. It is implied that the Bible is the minimum you should know and there may be certain things that He will communicate to help you personally if you ask Him. Waiting for God to answer is fairly short term, it is not the classic; Waiting For Godoe. God is for real.

2487,ME ,1176,54,,F,"I found myself in a tunnel comprised of dark red glass aperture-like structures which were opening up like a cameras aperture to receive me. I forced myself to look to the left to try to ascertain where I was. In between the aperture blades I could see I was in outer space. I saw a black sky all around with stars. When I turned to move forward again I could see in the distance what appeared to be the end of the tunnel. It was made up of a beige inflatable cushion-type structure. I quickly moved forward to reach the end. I was greeted by an elder angelic-like spirit who began asking me questions almost to verify my identity. I answered them, but after a while, I questioned why I needed to answer all these questions. After that, the being stepped to the right and before me I saw a bright blue sky with perfectly shaped green trees, which had leaves rustling by a gentle breeze, though I could not feel the breeze. Beyond the trees, I saw green lush rolling hills that seemed to go on forever. From my left appeared my deceased father, as he would have been at about 35 years old dressed all in white \xe2\x80\x93 a short-sleeved white tee shirt and white cotton-type pants. He had been 54 when he died. He seemed to communicate telepathically to me but I responded using physical speech. He initially asked me how I was. We turned in the direction of the rolling hills again and this time I saw many people all dressed in white silently walking in the right direction. I did not know these people or where they were going. He suggested we sit at a concrete garden table to the left with 2 concrete benches on either side. Beyond the table I noticed a one-story concrete building with no windows or doors that I could see. My father wanted to know how I was and said he was concerned about me. At the time, I was undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer (DCIS ductal carcinoma in situ, stage 0). I reassured him there was no need for concern as the radiation wasnt bothering me at all and the DCIS was not ever fatal. He told me he was very proud of me. After a time, He asked me to come around the table to where he was sitting so I could give him a hug goodbye. As I did, he asked me to forgive him. The encounter was pleasant up to that point. When he asked me to forgive him, all my memories of how he had been a strict disciplinarian came back to me and I started to feel badly, reliving those feelings I had as a child and teenager.

2490,NDE,1398,32,,F,"I remember a feeling of being sucked out of my body, sort of like separating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with all the stickiness and resistance. After I was completely separated I was observing from above as they were performing CPR and attaining IV access. The doctor put my body in Trudelenburg position. At this point, my attention is drawn away by a feeling that someone was calling me. My attention became focused on this sparkling light, I want to call it a warm glowing light but it is hard to describe because the physical sensation of warmth was not really present. As soon as I acknowledged this light, I was just in it. There were these rainbow orbs that spoke to me and there were people there in what I was communicated to be a sort of holding room. I didnt see anything other than people and orbs in this room that went on for what seemed like an eternity without walls or ceiling. Soon after, I remember laughing but not laughing like in a physical sense, but, in any case, laughing with the people in the room. It was like I ran into old friends and we just picked right back where we left off type of feeling. I dont really have a sense of time of how long I was there but I was guided to another location and there was a woman there who said that I was going to be experiencing what I termed a rewrite. This is so hard to put into words but she communicated to me that a different course was available to me if I so chose to follow it. I felt like everything was more real than anything I had ever experienced, so alive, so intelligent, so revealed. The woman was near a mountain, at the base of it in a vivacious green meadow. We sat for a while but I cannot put into words the things I learned, I dont even remember what I had learned until I come across events in my life that trigger the knowledge that was given to me. I know it sounds strange but it makes sense to me. I was given a choice. You can stay or you can go back. I remember asking questions, like, go back where? And as soon as I asked that question, I knew where. I dont think the complete question even came forth before the answer was already being revealed. This is when I could hear conversations going on. I could hear the people in my ICU room. Complete conversations. I became saddened and wanted to see but I was informed that I had to choose first. I heard my son crying, begging me to open my eyes. My attention went to the woman, her eyes were crystal clear pale blue eyes and she had long dark hair, dressed in a sort of plain creamy colored garb. She never spoke sound words, it was telepathic thoughts. She revealed different life traumas I had experienced up to that point; I was wondering why only the traumas and not the good times, and just as I had that thought the answer was that it serves a purpose and that purpose comes to me at different times since my near death. I also heard my mothers prayers and the prayers of others pleading for my health and wellness. I recall leaving the woman in the field and I just seemed to float away...into space...and it felt as if though I had rushed millions maybe even billions of miles away in seconds. I seen these other worlds and other peoples only to be drawn back in a flash to the holding room. It was time for me to decide and it seemed urgent; will I accept the rewrite or stay where I was; there was no right or wrong choice. Only my choice. I longed for my children, knowing that things would be very different in a bad way if I chose to stay. I was communicated that my road to recovery would be hard at first, but would get easier as time went by. It was hard for me to conceive how this time would be if I returned. I felt drawn back and chose to go back all the while knowing it was going to be difficult. As soon as I made the choice, the people in the holding room became ecstatic and exuberant and I thought this was the strangest occurrence of the whole ordeal. I all of a sudden felt the most unbearable discomfort, my body. I tried to open my eyes and couldnt, I felt the loudness of my heart beating at an unthinkable speed, I immediately came back out of my body and hovered over it for a moment before entering again. The next thing I remember is the nurses and doctor in the ICU room asking me to stay calm because I was connected to a ventilator. My hands were secured to restraints. I couldnt focus my eyes when I first came back, I had been in a coma for 9 days. I had apparently became septic after surgery and went into septic shock.

I was shocked that anyone could hate Him, but yes, people do and He is happy to let them go elsewhere. The musical colored light had brought me a complete mood change from agonizing mental pain to joy. I felt I would climb mountains and swim the sea for Jesus. He was jovial and amused, humble and enthralling.

2503,DEE,1297,67,,F,"Hank, my husband, and I were getting ready to move on December 10, 2012 from Ossining, New York to Milford, Connecticut. Most of the house was already packed up. I had gone through the whole coat closet downstairs by the front door, throwing stuff out and organizing what I wanted to pack up at that time or wait until moving day. There was a small shelf above the coat hangar bar that I looked over while standing on a stool to see what was up there and what needed to be thrown out. There were mostly gloves and hats which I kept there in case we needed them. We had just arrived home at night from eating out Thanksgiving Dinner on November 22, 2012. Hank hung up his coat first in the lit up coat closet. Then I took out a hangar, hung my coat on it and, while looking toward Hank and talking to him, I went to hang up my coat without looking at the bar or what I was doing because I knew that closet so well, after living in this house for 22 years. I had trouble getting the hangar hook to go over the bar. I tried and tried but the hook wouldnt go on the bar. It kept getting stuck on something. So I looked at the bar and saw there was a chain of some kind hanging down from the shelf above. There was a sliver of an opening between the slats of the wooden shelf and a chain had made its way through the opening and hung down in a loop, the narrow opening of which happened to be facing the tip of the hangar. So when I aimed, without looking, the tip of the hangar to go on the bar, it went through the narrow loop instead and got stuck there. I looked at the chain. I couldnt understand where this chain came from. I knew everything that was on the shelf and there was no chain. I pulled on the chain. It came down through the slat opening and a medallion of some kind followed it. I looked at this medallion with its long neck chain in the palm of my hand and just stared at it. I couldnt believe my eyes. That was my medallion and my chain that I had mysteriously lost 5 years previous. I had this piece of jewelry custom made for me, based on the image that I had seen when I was 29 years of age of a glow and cross. The medallion was a white Mother of Pearl flat, round disk (glow) with a MOP cross affixed onto the disk. When I received this gift to myself from the jeweler, I loved it and wore it every single day for about a year. One night Hank and I were going to a special place and I wanted to wear a special necklace that would conflict with the medallion and chain, so I took it off and probably placed it on my dresser in the bedroom, as I was planning to wear it again the next day. I either placed it on the top of my dresser or put it into my jewelry drawer in the dresser. The next day when I awoke, I looked for the medallion to put it on again and I couldnt find it. I looked on the dresser top, in all the drawers, on the floor around the dresser, in our bedroom, in the bathrooms and in all the rooms of my home, but Hank and I couldnt find it. It was missing for about 5 years and during those years, I kept on looking all over my house for the medallion, but with no luck. Then I thought that God was mad at me for taking it off, so It took it away. So, 5 years later, God had miraculously given back to me my medallion in such an incredible way. I showed it to Hank in disbelief. He was amazed how that medallion came back to me, and 5 years later! Then I told Hank that I had a bad thought, that It gave it back to me because something bad or hard was going to happen during or after our move and I would need this medallion that I loved so much and which connected me to God and Its serenity. Ive been wearing the medallion every day since and will wear it every single day always, even if it doesnt go with a fancy outfit. Our move was hard but Hank and I survived it and are doing well. Although we have to move again in a year and dont know where we will live, though we want to stay in Milford.

2505,ADC,1407,44,,F,"During my few encounters while I was asleep, I always woke up a little amused I had another message from Dad. I always felt his presence in my dream like he was sitting next to me. These were really clear, concise experiences. I experienced him as though he was in his 20s vibrant,strong, full head of hair, but with the persona of when he died in his 80s. The last one I had was the one that had the most dramatic influence on my spiritual life. He communicated with me about something mundane again I actually dont recall the issue now. But after that communication, he told me that he would not be communicating with me anymore. I cant say that it was like a conversation. It was more like just receiving this knowledge in a full block, or like being filled with it. The communication gave me the knowledge that it was difficult for him to be sort of tethered to this world because where he was was so glorious and full of joy that he just couldnt maintain a focus on my world anymoe. With that communication was delivered a sense or an experience of that glory and joy. I was overwhelmed with the thought of it. I woke up in tears for both what I had seen and also knowing that what I thought was an almost funny link to my deceased father that would go on for the rest of my life, was over. I havent heard from him since, but I feel the experience gave me knowledge that I almost wasnt supposed to have.

2506,NDE,1398,32,,F,"I remember a feeling of being sucked out of my body, sort of like separating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with all the stickiness and resistance. After I was completely separated I was observing from above as they were performing CPR and attaining IV access. The doctor put my body in Trudelenburg position. At this point, my attention is drawn away by a feeling that someone was calling me. My attention became focused on this sparkling light, I want to call it a warm glowing light but it is hard to describe because the physical sensation of warmth was not really present. As soon as I acknowledged this light, I was just in it. There were these rainbow orbs that spoke to me and there were people there in what I was communicated to be a sort of holding room. I didnt see anything other than people and orbs in this room that went on for what seemed like an eternity without walls or ceiling. Soon after, I remember laughing but not laughing like in a physical sense, but, in any case, laughing with the people in the room. It was like I ran into old friends and we just picked right back where we left off type of feeling. I dont really have a sense of time of how long I was there but I was guided to another location and there was a woman there who said that I was going to be experiencing what I termed a rewrite. This is so hard to put into words but she communicated to me that a different course was available to me if I so chose to follow it. I felt like everything was more real than anything I had ever experienced, so alive, so intelligent, so revealed. The woman was near a mountain, at the base of it in a vivacious green meadow. We sat for a while but I cannot put into words the things I learned, I dont even remember what I had learned until I come across events in my life that trigger the knowledge that was given to me. I know it sounds strange but it makes sense to me. I was given a choice. You can stay or you can go back. I remember asking questions, like, go back where? And as soon as I asked that question, I knew where. I dont think the complete question even came forth before the answer was already being revealed. This is when I could hear conversations going on. I could hear the people in my ICU room. Complete conversations. I became saddened and wanted to see but I was informed that I had to choose first. I heard my son crying, begging me to open my eyes. My attention went to the woman, her eyes were crystal clear pale blue eyes and she had long dark hair, dressed in a sort of plain creamy colored garb. She never spoke sound words, it was telepathic thoughts. She revealed different life traumas I had experienced up to that point; I was wondering why only the traumas and not the good times, and just as I had that thought the answer was that it serves a purpose and that purpose comes to me at different times since my near death. I also heard my mothers prayers and the prayers of others pleading for my health and wellness. I recall leaving the woman in the field and I just seemed to float away...into space...and it felt as if though I had rushed millions maybe even billions of miles away in seconds. I seen these other worlds and other peoples only to be drawn back in a flash to the holding room. It was time for me to decide and it seemed urgent; will I accept the rewrite or stay where I was; there was no right or wrong choice. Only my choice. I longed for my children, knowing that things would be very different in a bad way if I chose to stay. I was communicated that my road to recovery would be hard at first, but would get easier as time went by. It was hard for me to conceive how this time would be if I returned. I felt drawn back and chose to go back all the while knowing it was going to be difficult. As soon as I made the choice, the people in the holding room became ecstatic and exuberant and I thought this was the strangest occurrence of the whole ordeal. I all of a sudden felt the most unbearable discomfort, my body. I tried to open my eyes and couldnt, I felt the loudness of my heart beating at an unthinkable speed, I immediately came back out of my body and hovered over it for a moment before entering again. The next thing I remember is the nurses and doctor in the ICU room asking me to stay calm because I was connected to a ventilator. My hands were secured to restraints. I couldnt focus my eyes when I first came back, I had been in a coma for 9 days. I had apparently became septic after surgery and went into septic shock. On entering the ICU on July 1, 2002, I slipped into a coma, they intubated me, and there I lay dying until July 9th, my daughters birthday. A few hours had passed and I kept seeing people that the nurses said were not there and experiencing odd things like seeing fish swimming in the air.

2508,NDA,1386,17,,F,"One night, I had a dream. I remember being outside of my grandfather house. Outside of the house was my grandfather. He approached me, and we were happy to see each other. I knew it had been a while since I saw him. And, I also knew that she was currently sick and afraid of him leaving me [to the afterlife]. My grandfather took my hand, and we walked into his house. The view inside the house, during the dream, was identical to his real house. What I found unusual was that all the lights were out except the one straight ahead- his room.  As we proceeded to walk towards his room, he was telling me that things were going to be fine. That, at first, things were going to feel like they are spinning out of control. As if I was standing with my arms out, spinning in circles, losing my balance- THAT type of loss of control. Although I found comfort in his words, I didnt know what he actually meant, until after his death.  When we approached the bedroom door, I could not believe my eyes. In front of me, was a hospital bed and my grandfather was in it! My grandfather was in his bed, facing my direction; he was asleep. Behind him, sitting, was his 2nd wife, his daughter, Lucy, and his son, Danny. To my left [and my grandfathers], sitting on a chair, was my mother. All of them were looking straight at my grandfather. I could not believe that I was in the presence of two grandfathers- and the same one!!  Seeing my grandfather in the hospital bed created a magnetic pull. I could not remove my eyes from him. I had never seen him in such a state. He was always alert, active, and immediately greeting me. This was the first time that I ever saw him so disconnected from everyone else, especially in their presence.  Seeing that there was an empty chair right next to his bed, I immediately sat on it. I felt I was trying to be close to him as I possibly could. This was the man I had loved all my life. He was my father, my comfort, and my strength. I admired this man profusely. And, knowing that I had denied seeing him for so many months, he needed to know I was finally there.  I apologized to him for not being there for when he needed me the most. I told him I was scared of losing him and I was scared that he would pass away once he already saw me. (He had seen every family member, but me. Due to how our relationship was, my withdrawal had shocked everyone. I thought you loved your grandfather, why arent you seeing him? You know that he is dying. Go see him.) Once I finished venting to my grandfather, asking him for forgiveness, his eyes opened. He looked at me. I returned the look. And he closed them again. Right then I knew that I was right. He WAS waiting for me. He wasnt leaving yet because we hadnt said goodbye. And I was the last person that he needed to see. But, I knew that I wasnt ready to let him go. Feeling overwhelmed, I reached out to him. I went for his hand and I grabbed it. It was my first touch with him in months. And once I held his hand, I heard his last breath. I was then informed he died. Everyone around was crying, including myself. With the pain of a broken heart, and having everything feel so real, I immediately woke up from my dream. I woke up sweating and bursting into tears. I could not stop crying. I had felt as if my grandfather had truly passed away.  My mother, who was sleeping next to me at the time (she didnt want to be alone during this moment in her life- being a daddys girl) woke up with fright. She didnt know what happened to me. I relived the dream by telling her every single detail. She reached out to a relative who informed her that my grandfather was still alive. - Exactly one week later, still fearful of my dream, and still avoiding seeing my dying grandfather, my mom informed me that she had just seen my grandfather. She informed me that now it was just a matter of hours or minutes. Without thinking, I immediately got ready. It was probably 10:00-11:00 at night. On my way over there, those fears werent present. But once I walked up to my grandfathers door- all my fears came flooding back. I did not know what to expect. Was my dream just a dream? Or, would it become a reality?? As my mother and I walked in through the door. My heart slumped to the bottom of my stomach. Just like my dream- the house was dark except for the back room- my grandfathers room. I began to experience anxiety. I was praying my steps towards the room would be nothing like my dream. I had so much hope in those few seconds which felt like an hour. When I walked into the bedroom, there he was: my grandfather laying on a bed, facing my direction. Behind him, my 2nd wife, my aunt Lucy, and my uncle Danny. My mother took a seat to my left. And I, I was offered the empty seat next to him. The seat from my dreams!  I had so many thoughts come up.

2509,OBE,1552,9,,M,"The dream/experience seems to begin as usual but I started to notice things that I wouldnt normally catch my attention. The first item I recall was looking down at the cloverleaf intersection of the SR55 freeway (we called the Newport freeway even though its officially known as the Costa Mesa freeway) and Interstate 5. It was odd as it seemed as though it was daytime not nighttime. The next commented I made to myself was I could see the top of an apartment building nearby and the air conditioning units on the rooftop. Shortly after that point I felt or sensed something above me. A feeling of warm love and a golden light radiating from above but all around caught my attention. As it did, I slowly ascended towards this wonderful place above me but after a few moment I felt the presence of two beings. I dont seem to recall actually seeing anyone I just felt/knew they were there. There seemed to be something humorous or playful about them I want to say angels but it seems awkward to do so..... Anyway they told me I could not be there and that I had to go back, it was a little disappointing to hear but I didnt feel bad. I agreed after a bit and started to head down and when I felt there attention drift I turned back and headed towards the light. They quickly appeared or I felt them nearby and again they said I had to return. This time I, in the way of a child said, but its so wonderful I dont want too. At this, the beings, almost with a feeling of good humor and laughter said I had too! I played with them a bit trying to continue up but gave in and woke right up in bed.

2514,OBE,1531,30,,F,"I must first start out by explaining that I have had OBEs my entire life, beginning when I was about 9 or 10 years old. It was at this age that I began watching tv programs about people being visited by their guardian angels, or other such spirits, who had saved their lives, or sent these people messages of some monumental significance.  I was very much affected by these programs and began praying to god, or to whoever was listening to me, for some sign of the \xe2\x80\x98other side,\xe2\x80\x99 because I knew deep inside that there was more to life and I wanted to experience it firsthand as these other people did. I prayed every day obsessively and even created my own Ouija board out of paper and a ring, thinking I could make some sort of connection. The ring did eventually move, to my astonishment, but it was just my own energy that I was becoming aware of. So I began to feel my own energy throughout my body, as I do to this day, although for some time I believed it was a spirit taking over my body because it felt so foreign at the time, and as a young child I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better.  Shortly after being aware of my own energy I began to feel my energy leave my body at night when I was falling asleep.  It was incredibly startling and disturbing, as it would jolt me awake, just as I was beginning to fall asleep. As I would awaken my energy would immediately slam back into my body. As a child I thought this was the devil taking my soul away, and I used to cry and pray to god at night. This happened all the time, and it was very frightening, and there was no one I could tell because I knew I would sound crazy. One night when I was crying and praying, I suddenly felt \xe2\x80\x93and had the image of- someone kissing my cheek. I felt the energy touch my face and sink into my skin- and then I felt an immense, overwhelming wave of intense love encompass my entire body, and I knew in my soul that I was loved and taken care of, that I was perfectly safe. I was in complete shock, and my tears turned to tears of joy- someone had responded to my prayers! I knew I was going to be ok! Somehow whatever was happening to me at night was not as horrible as I thought it was\xe2\x80\xa6and so I let it happen, knowing I was protected. I was so stunned by what happened-I had truly made a connection, the connection I had been yearning for. I knew there was more to this life, I knew there was nothing to fear, that someone or something was looking out for me. My fear of evil dissipated. I got used to feeling my energy leave my body at night, and it became a familiar sensation. Years later I would meet a friend in high school who would explain me that what I was experiencing was astral projection, and I would read books on the subject, as well as on many other metaphysical topics. As a teenager I would meditate and consciously expand my awareness, teaching myself to experience that profound love again and again, I would see auras, and have many other eye-opening spiritual experiences.  Throughout the years I have experienced OBEs in my dreams quite often, where I am flying around outside, in my house, out in space, all over the place. It is a fabulous feeling. I have not been able to consciously leave my body, though-only in dreams. As an adult I am very spiritual but I do not believe in any one religion or doctrine, nor in any god, heaven or hell, or in evil. I believe in my experiences, and in a profound and universal love that we are all a part of, not separate from, because of what I have felt and witnessed in my lifetime over and over again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 20 yrs old, and I was on lithium for 10 years when we come to the present time when this story unfolds, in July of 2013. There are many other events surrounding my experience I am to speak of, which are important to mention. At the time I most likely had lithium toxicity, as I was physically sick and severely confused, and my body was in convulsions for what seemed like weeks. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat very well on my own due to the spasms and it took me an immense amount of time to get dressed and perform normal tasks due to the uncontrollable spasms caused by lithium toxicity. I never knew what day it was it was or what had even happened the day before. I was in bad shape. At the same time I was also malnourished for reasons I can only speculate onmy boyfriend had recently broken up with me so I had fallen into a deep depression, I was hardly eating, forgetting to take my meds, and hardly sleeping. I most likely was suffering from a mental breakdown.

And I am aware that I am your child as well and you will have to help me. At that precise moment I felt a shift in my sons breathing. In the upper left corner of the room I became aware of a brilliant and luminescent light. This light slowly grew and filled the upper quadrant of the darkened room. I honestly thought that I was having a stress induced migraine and was having an aura. However, when I turned my head the aura did not follow with my movements. The light remained in that left upper corner of the room. The brightness of it grew and grew and enlarged to where it filled the room. I tried to look at the light but it was too bright. The light was the most brilliant and beautiful light that I have even seen. I had never (and still have never) seen anything like it. It was more than light...like it had consistancy. And then this incredible awareness occurred and my thought was oh my God, its God. And in that moment I becamse aware that God was/is more real than anything else that I had ever seen or known. My perception of God changed in that instance from my being a skeptic to the assurance that God is a definite and known entity. It was as real as anything that I have ever seen. I felt bathed in this glow and felt warmed....held and loved. Im not sure how long this lasted but slowly the light rescended but the awareness did not. The feeling that I had was the peace that surpasses all understanding. I knew that my son was going to be fine. My chills disappeared and I felt no more worry or anxiety. The doctors continued to check on my son and finally an hour after the light appeared they came in and said we think that hes turned the corner. I felt like they sure got the news on a delayed schedule. For a long time I felt that I was having some stress response to my sons health crisis but the knowing has never receded. Ive ever since referred to this as my near death experience by proxy. My son improved and was released from the hospital several days later. That event still is vivid and real in my mind like it happened yesterday. The awareness and belief from that experience has continued on to this day.

2520,ME ,1478,46,,M,"This life changing event happened to me the latter part of October 2004  For many years I\xe2\x80\x99d been searching for a closer walk with God and financial success. My library of books and tapes are very extensive. I have read many books over twice and listened to tapes and CD\xe2\x80\x99s over and over and over again. I\xe2\x80\x99d started this learning process about 5 years ago and for the last three years I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten very serious about it. So much so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t read the paper, I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch the news on TV and my TV time is limited to almost nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve rented about 5 movies in the last five years. No movie theaters and I\xe2\x80\x99d recently turned off the car radio of any type of media or learning material and just thought positive thoughts while driving. The books that I read are the Bible, books on how our minds work, books on Personal Development and Spirituality. However I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe that the Spirit world existed So one day I have no Idea how I got there but I\xe2\x80\x99m on the website of a well known Success coach and trainer. On her site an interesting book catches my eye. I order the book and it arrives quickly. I start reading the book and it makes allot of sense. About a third way through the book I come upon a passage that says \xe2\x80\x9cOk, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to now tell you about my 5 agreements in business not to be confused with the Four Agreements of Don Miguel Ruiz. If you want to learn about his four agreements you can get his book titled the Four Agreements and read about them\xe2\x80\x9d.  Nothing else was mentioned about that subject and I kept reading. About 3 pages after that statement I felt compelled to go back. I found the author and the title of the book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Four Agreements\xe2\x80\x9d. I was sitting at my desk in front of my computer so I went to Ebay and clicked on a Buy It Now and had the book in my hand three day\xe2\x80\x99s later. I thought it came to me very quickly. The book is written I am told, at a sixth grade level and it has about 140 pages. So I ate it up and read it in about 3 days. After reading it I thought to myself. This book makes so much sense. Just 4 agreements and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to memorize a bunch of affirmations and make sure that I find the right one to say for the situation in my stack of 3X5\xe2\x80\x99 cards. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking this is one of the best books I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and it\xe2\x80\x99s so simple to understand and implement. So I go in for round two with this book. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read it again. About half way through the book is when it happens. My vision: It\xe2\x80\x99s 10:00am and I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting at my home office desk reading the book for the second time. The morning light is shining through my French doors. I\xe2\x80\x99m about half way through it when the room goes dark. I turn my chair to the left toward the light switch to see who\xe2\x80\x99s there. I stand and I drop the book to the floor out of my left hand. My desk is to my right. The book lands on a wood floor, bounces a couple of times and makes an echo like a book bouncing on a wood floor in an empty room. (The floor in my office is carpeted) I look around my room and it\xe2\x80\x99s not my room anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s now as large as a high school gym and empty of everything except for my desk and chair and the floor is wood. My Room looks like an empty school gym. It is then that I see my office door. It\xe2\x80\x99s glowing and the colors on it have changed from white to Lapis Blue and the handle on the door is glowing an Orange/Gold color. The door appears to be breathing in and out. On it\xe2\x80\x99s in breath the door is puffed up and show cracks with the orange/gold color in them. The door and handle are illuminated like they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to explode and catch fire. I see smoke coming in from the door jam around the door frame on its out breath. I walk slowly to the door and grab the handle. I turn it clockwise and crack the door open about an inch to peak outside my room. An intense and bright white light comes through the one inch space. It startles me because of its intense brightness and the speed at which it came through the door so close to my face. The light is just like a laser. It is focused. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like it\xe2\x80\x99s flooding the room with light it\xe2\x80\x99s like a laser beam of bright white/golden light 1 inch wide and as tall as the door. In the light are many small brown particles about the size of pencil erasers. They\xe2\x80\x99re floating and moving along in the light, going by me, not real fast as they come in the door.   Then I open the door all the way. The door opens inward and from left to right.

2522,OBE,1371,26,,M,"What I observed, felt and saw were the most real things I ever experienced. As I slept, I didnt just float away I shot off like a rocket. I was going warp speed with a destination pre-programmed. I didnt know consciously where I was headed, I just knew I was going. It was very much the sensation of flying through space. It was dark like space, but I dont remember darkness. I do recall zooming past worlds, orbs really, not planets in the physical sense, but worlds nonetheless, near and far. I traveled at this warp speed what I could sense was a vast distance, multitudes beyond what we even have measurements for. When I came out of my travels, I found myself in the presence of these two men as described above.  And HERE is the most remarkable, profound, and intense part of this experience: Despite their important work of apparently saving a large population, when I arrived there, they both turned their full attention to me. Here, words truly lose their meaning. I have great reverence for these two men and the work they were seemingly doing, yet despite this they afforded me their full attention and admiration and love. They were happy to see ME! But it was so much more than that. I felt all of the infinite and unconditional love of the universe, the acceptance, everything Dr. Eben discussed in his book, if I may use that cop-out in lieu of attempting to describe the indescribable.  At the time, I had been dealing with being disrespected as a new EMT in a culture that big on attitude and tradition and small on respect. I learned one of the most important lessons of my life in that moment: That every being on earth is greeted with %1,000 full attention, love, admiration, and acceptance by God, with no regard to anything else thats going on. I cant fathom how its possible to everywhere and doing everything at once, despite the fact that I experienced beings capable of that while making me the center and sole focus of all that infinite love.  I clumsily and, I feel, stupidly introduced myself as Josh, from Oregon, as though that would have made sense. It did, apparently. As we all floated above this world with refugees down below, information was exchanged. There was a discussion. I do not recall nor did I upon waking- that discussion that was shared between the three of us. I was there to experience what I had upon my arrival. My mother, whom I was best friends with, died in 2002. My family was shattered, but I was the apple of my mothers eye. Her death is something that I still havent dealt with fully. I sense that this was at the heart of that exchange, however it was with some other part of me that I dont have access to right now.  When this conversation concluded, whatever it was, I remember making the journey back to my body. It was the exact same immeasurable distance, yet the time it took was very... well, there was no quick or slow about it. It just was. When I arrived back to my body, I snapped awake.  I immediately called my father who had been close friends with Pir Vilayat. My dad was very supportive and receptive, even happy that I had such a special dream.

2525,ME ,1270,29,,F,"In 1974 I was 29 years of age. (I am now 67 years of age.) I was feeling pretty despondent at that time, having spent four years trying to make a living as a visual fine artist in Manhattan but not succeeding. Not knowing how else to support myself, I enlisted in the Army. But as the day of my enlistment grew near, I was becoming increasingly anxious and fearful. I was a free spirit and knew I would hate losing my freedom and someone else telling me what to do. But if I didnt go, I didnt know how else to take care of myself. I did not want to go back to secretarial work, not after I fell in love with art. I was stuck in a tight spot.  Three days before the big day, I was sitting on my hotel bed. I had given up my apartment in Little Italy and took a room for 3 months in a midtown Manhattan hotel. I was just staring out into my room, not knowing which way to turn. It was daytime. With the suddenness of a light switch just turned on, a brilliant white, round glow with a more brilliant Christian cross embedded in the middle of the glow appeared before my eyes. The vision was suspended in mid air. The glow and cross were about ten inches tall and sat about eight feet in front of me, a little lower than my eye level. The light that emanated from the glow was contained. There werent any rays coming from it. The whole cross fit totally within the glow. The cross was a plain, elegant cross with no detail. The ends of the narrow vertical and horizontal bars were cut straight across. (This vision was entirely visual. I didnt feel, smell or hear anything.) Although the glow and cross were as intensely bright as a flame, I stared easily into it. I wasnt afraid by its presence or doubted what was before my eyes. I never said to myself, What is this? or Why is a Christian cross coming to me? I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish. Actually, my mind was blank, without any thoughts. But I was transfixed by this sight, spiritually locked into it. I was aware that the glow and cross were calming me down, making me feel peaceful and serene. I think I was staring at it for a short period of time, maybe 15 minutes.  I remember how the glow and cross came on but I dont remember how it went away. After staring at it, I think I put my head down on a pillow and went to sleep. But the strange thing is that when I awoke, not only wasnt the vision still there but I didnt even remember that I saw it. Actually, I didnt remember this event until 30 years later, when I was sitting in my car experiencing my epiphany, which I talked about in my February 23 submission to you. Looking back at that time, the glow and cross did not tell me if I should go into the Army or not. What this vision did was to calm me down, relax me and relieve me of a paralyzing anxiety which was keeping me from seeing clearly and making the right decision for myself. Relaxed and clear thinking, I made the easy decision to withdraw from my Army enlistment. I went to the Army base and explained how I felt. The female officer there agreed and gave me an honorable discharge.

2533,ADC,1402,29,,F,"At the time, I described it as the most real and vivid dream I have ever had. In the dream, my deceased grandfather was communicating with me. He had passed away approximately ten years earlier and I had always said that I couldnt believe how much I missed him, even so many years after his death. This was my first loss and I took his death very hard because he had always been my father figure- my birth father had never been around (and died when I was 5), AND my relationship with my adoptive father was not close at all. Some specific details of the dream were not clear such as where we were or in what capacity my grandfather came to me, but I do remember that in the dream, I was very aware that it was impossible (in my understanding) for him to be there, communicating with me. My response in the dream was basically, How can this be, you are dead? I dont believe he said much to me, but I was so excited to have this time with him and I remember wanting to introduce him to my life since his death. I had no kids when he died and I wasnt married although I was dating my now husband. So, in the dream, I was feverishly trying to catch him up on all the events of my life...getting married, having two beautiful kids, going to university to become a teacher. I wanted him to be proud of me and I wanted so desperately to keep him around and involved in my life.  When I woke up, I truly felt that I had really lived this dream...a feeling I had never had with a dream and I remember wanting to cry because it was so real and vivid and now that I was awake, I couldnt get it back.

2536,ME ,1009,18,,F,"One of the weirdest things about this experience was the feeling of getting shot in the head. Actually, I didnt feel a thing, but I remember how my vision exploded in red. I remember how I vaguely felt my body hitting the ground and being unable to stop it, even as I, as a spirit, got yanked out of my body. I didnt feel a bit of pain, and Im usually very scared of blood, but I wasnt scared of the blood I saw coming out of me as I died--just intrigued, but not emotionally connected to it. As a spirit, I learned that I look very different than how I look physically. This experience taught me that I, Theresa, am actually a combination of three women who I was in other lifetimes--and I learned that we dont have to live our lifetimes in chronological order, and those lifetimes can overlap on each other, too. I learned that I, Theresa, am a combination of these three women:-a German Jewish girl who was about sixteen when she died in one of the concentration camps during the Holocaust-an American (Caucasian) woman who was in her 30s when she died in the 1980s-a Caucasian woman with shoulder-length, flaming red hair who was the captain of a starship and had died in the 2300s or thereabouts. She was in her late 20s-early 30s. Id lived all three of these lifetimes before this one. I learned that I, Theresa, am a composite of all three of these women. Im not exactly my own person. Im unique, yes--but I was created from these three women. Looking back on whats happened in the 2000s in our physical world, Im astounded that I basically saw our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan several years before they happened. Back in 1998, it was a lot easier to dismiss this experience as some really vivid dream, emphasis on dream. When I was 18, I couldnt fathom circumstances when the US would choose to wage war against anyone else. It was really easy to dismiss this aspect of my experience as something out of an action movie, perhaps. And I distinctly felt what the other soldiers were feeling--this grief over the fact that they knew, at the time of their deaths, that they would be dying so far away from home for a pointless war. The soldiers in my dream knew this full well as they died. They were extremely sad about this. If I had to describe it, it was like they had this immense, low, wailing grief--something very heavy and sad, like low, gray storm clouds. Back in 1998, one of the things that really amazed me was that the littlest promises we make are, indeed, kept. To go back to this brother of mine: We were fans of James Camerons movie, TITANIC, and we met in an email mailing list. We ended up talking a lot via IM. I dont think we ever exchanged pictures, even. But he was the first to say that he felt like I was his little sister, which was odd because he is an only child, like me. He liked calling me Sis a lot, and I called him big bro, although I dont think I felt this sibling bond quite as strongly as he did. We did talk about the supernatural, and about life beyond death. He talked about being in the US Army for some period of time. I dont know how our conversations got to this point, but we made a promise to each other: that if it really was true that there was life beyond death, whoever would die first would go to the other person and be there for them when it was their time to die. In the case of my experience, I died first and, as promised, I visited him--even if I, at least, had completely forgotten about making this promise in the first place.

2550,DEE,1124,47,,M,"Testimony on God\xe2\x80\x99s Power As revealed to Conrad February 5, 2007, 6:25AM to 9:25AM Introduction My name is Conrad; I was born in the Philippines and was raised in a Roman Catholic family. I was an altar boy during my Catechism years. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the bible twice from cover to cover when I was young and every time I get to the crucifixion part, I cried. Some parts of the bible I would easily understand, but I also got confused in others. As I grew up a verse from the bible kept playing in my mind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which part of the bible it came from but it went like this \xe2\x80\x9cSeek ye first the Kingdom of God \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d and that is what I did. I went about seeking the Kingdom of God, read many books of different titles and pretty soon I discovered the wonders of Science and how it can reasonably explain things that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. The more science books I read the more convinced I was that things that were once mysterious can be scientifically explained and verified. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed in proving things undoubtedly before I believed it and accepted it. I only wanted to believe in known and proven facts.  And so I went through College and read even more books and gained more knowledge. I excelled in class but not good enough to have any honors because of my laziness and procrastination. You see, I would do well in exams, in fact I\xe2\x80\x99d be top in exams but not accomplish my homework or lab works so I also had grades that were just average. As my learning progressed I discovered that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need God to have a life or to live my life. I believed this with conviction and even had a theory that men created God and not the other way around. I wrote a thesis on how during the early stages of evolution men might have created God because there were many things they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand or were unable to explain. They attributed those things to an all knowing creator and consequently created a God. A friend of mine presented it as an English class project and almost got kicked out by the instructor. (That\xe2\x80\x99s how blasphemous it appeared but when you think deeper you can discern that men if left alone will instinctively seek God. We are the only creation that actively seek and try to understand our origins.) I went on with my life for years not believing or needing God until I got married to my wife Elisa in 1986 when we were both working in the Middle East. Our marriage did not give a child for almost five years. We went to see doctors and specialists in hospitals and clinics but we were unsuccessful. A surgery for me and standard medical procedures done for my wife did not result in conception. I desperately wanted a child and I would do anything to have one. I started wondering \xe2\x80\x9cAm I being punished for not believing in God?\xe2\x80\x9d Despite all these disappointments, we continued seeing fertility specialists. We also had Artificial Insemination in the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines. In December 1989, we went back to the Philippines for a much needed month long vacation. And one Sabbath day in January 1990, at the Manila Center (an SDA church in Manila, Philippines), a pastor from California was leading a service and he had a sermon about the earth being like a washing machine for dirty souls. He said \xe2\x80\x9cThe Earth is used by God to wash and clean souls to make them fit to go to heaven and live with God.\xe2\x80\x9d It opened my mind and I understood then why I needed God in my life. I wept and cried uncontrollably. It caught the Pastor\xe2\x80\x99s attention and I guess he pitied my poor soul so much that he gave me his Bible and even signed it. That night I prayed hard, a really sincere prayer to God and I asked Him to give me a child. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d I prayed \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a real God, and really powerful God, give me a child and I will convert to the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\xe2\x80\x9d Back to the UAE on February 1990, my wife tested positive for pregnancy and in November 29, 1990, our daughter Ari was born. I thought about my promise to God and the implications of that promise. My parents and siblings, my Catholic friends would hate me I thought, I would miss food that I grew accustomed to eating. I cringed at these possibilities and so I kept living my life the way I wanted and I justified my actions with some semi-scientific reasoning to deny God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing of a daughter for my wife and me. Fast forward to 2007, we have since moved to the US, we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in Boca Raton, Florida, New Orleans, LA and presently, The Woodlands, TX.

It was daytime and I was preparing some food when my eye caught an object by the floor. I looked down and saw a little white square paper wedged up against the dark green backsplash runner by the floor. I picked up the paper. It was actually an empty little envelope with a gold lining inside. The envelope looked like it was opened after it was sealed because it had a rip in the flap. It was the kind of gift envelope that contained a card with someones name on it that youd give with a gift at Christmas. On the front of the envelope was the hand-printed word Dad. It looked like my handwriting but I didnt remember giving my father this envelope in the 2 1/2 years we were communicating just before his passing, and we didnt talk to each other for 29 years previously. In my home, a random and obscure object just doesnt turn up mysteriously in a strange place like that. I stood there with a shocked feeling, staring at the envelope.

I asked if it was his. He said no. I asked if he ever saw this before. No. Could he imagine where it came from? No. I asked if it fell out of the newspapers he recycles in the kitchen. He said no. I told him where I found it and that it came from Holy Spirit. Hank became agitated and got a little angry. He was annoyed that mysterious, spiritual things like this were happening to me and darted back upstairs to his office. I stood there looking at the envelope and asked out loud: Dad, are you here with me now? Suddenly, a brisk wind came across my bare shins and I felt the chills. Then I knew my father was with me. I wanted to know more about this mystery, so I called a cousin of Hanks who was a Deacon at a Catholic Church in New Orleans. I asked Gary what all this meant. He said that God made my father my Guardian Angel and that my father would be watching over me. This was awesome. Although I had had a love/hate relationship with my father, I just loved him now and was happy to know he was with me. I have fond, loving memories bonding with my father in my childhood and enjoying life with him. (Im uploading a photo of this envelope.

2565,ME ,1030,49,,F,"I pulled onto the Interstate and slid into the left lane. The car in front of me was a red convertible and as I pulled closer I realized that I knew by the vanity plates who the person was driving the car. The plates were and I knew that was the owner of the Hotel who we knew socially. Then a voice spoke to me and gave me instructions and reasons why all at the same time and in just a few seconds I had been told what I had to do to be safe. The voice explained that the car was about to go out of control and speed into the center median. Then the person driving it would over-correct and speed across the interstate in front of me just in time for me to T-bone the car and kill both of us. The voice told me to simply take my foot off the gas and coast...that would slow my car enough to avoid hitting the car and the semis behind me would not hit me. Just exactly as the instructions were completed I took my foot off the gas and the entire scene played out before me. The car started running off to the left into the median kicking grass up and speeding toward the steel barrier...at 1st I thought it would be sliced in 2 right down the middle, but then the driver began to swerve back into my lane. He cut across 2 lanes...and because I had already slowed down ...he missed me by inches...clipped the car behind me and to my right and slammed into the guard-rail on the other side of the interstate.

2573,NDE,1388,54,,M,"Bam!  That had to be a plane, I thought to myself. Nothing else could possibly be moving that fast. The force of the impact had snapped the drivers seat off and I felt the car being catapulted forward. That in itself was alarming.  I had been traveling north on I-75 just north of Atlanta, GA and had just been readying to exit the North Marietta Loop traveling at about 60 mph when the impact from behind had occurred. Just a couple minutes prior I had seen some jets taking off from Dobbins Air Base. It wasnt a plane that hit me though. It was an uninsured 19 yr old driving an unregistered vehicle. Witness reports put his speed at over a 100 mph as he wove in and out of traffic coming up I-75.  The impact caused the back end of my car to jerk out to the right. The wheels on my Toyata Corolla seemed to grab the road surface. I could feel the car begin to turn over. I knew how fast I was going. I knew the car would be turning over and over in a wild tumble. It was without a doubt one of those entire life in a flash moments. There wasnt a lot of time for any lengthy reminiscing though.  Just two thoughts went through my mind. The first was a pondering why Divine Spirit had chosen this time for me. Wow, I really thought Ive learned a lot in this life. Im just at the point in life where I might be able to offer others something worthwhile. Why now?  The second thought was expressed in a spirit of surrendering, God, I really only have one request. Id really like to take all that Ive learned with me to my next life. Please dont require me to learn everything all over again. Reincarnation is something that Im completely familiar and comfortable with.  The car began to flip over. I could hear the metal shearing and the glass shattering all around me. I felt the tumbling effect. I felt like I was inside a long tunnel like whirlpool. In the center of that incredibly fast spinning darkness I saw a bright white light, warm like the sun, very quiet and very serene.  Total silence.  I opened my eyes. Cool, I thought. I made it through this and Im not even hurt! No pain at all!  Then I tried to move. Not so much as a finger responded. I was lying face down, head in the back seat, my feet somewhere up around the area of the steering wheel. A thumb was pressing hard against my nose and lip. I could see that it appeared, by its relative positioning, to be the thumb from my left hand, but it was my right thumb. I could also see that my right arm bent in an awkward position under my throat. God, Im glad Im paralyzed because that would really hurt if I could feel it, I said to myself.  Totally paralyzed, I thought to myself. Quadriplegic. I will be a burden on everyone for the rest of my life.  I then concluded that because I was unable to feel any pain, that I probably had serious internal injuries as well. I would die here, but at least I would die without pain. I thanked Divine Spirit for that blessing.  I could literally feel myself, as Spirit, sinking slowly down and out of my body. It was a deeply sickening feeling. Then I heart a tapping sound. Are you all right? a womans trembling voice asked.  Im paralyzed. Call the police, call the ambulance. I said. At least I could talk, I thought to myself.  That started a flurry of activity. Over the next half hour, I heard sirens, people yelling and screaming, and the unmistakable sound of a helicopter. All the while I laid face down, head in the back seat, not moving. All the doors were jammed. The parameds were frantically trying to reach me and couldnt. They kept saying, Stay with us now, stay with us. They ended up cutting off the entire roof of the car and very carefully they lifted me out. I was placed on a stretcher, moved to level ground, and was immediately given an IV.  At least 5 or 6 medical personal surrounded me. The one directly above my face said to me, Mr., youre going to be all right. Then a womans voice said, Mr., have you made arrangements for organ transplants?  Yeah, I said. Its on my drivers license. I could see the guy directly above me stare down the lady who said it.  Then another voice spoke up. Mr, do you have a living will?  No, I said. I looked up at the guy above me and said, Im in it pretty deep, huh?  He smiled down at me and said Id be fine. Yeah, right, I thought to myself.  They strapped me in the lifeflight helicopter. Off I went to the Atlanta Medical Center Spinal Trauma Unit, the best such facility for hundreds of miles in all directions. Upon arriving I was placed in the operating room recovery room. Apparently there was more room there for all the medical personnel to gather round me.  After being taken for CAT Scans and an MRI I was returned to the recovery room. After the initial blur of activity, another seriously injured person was brought into the room. She was obviously near death. The doctors",,    Q.

2581,ADC,1385,37,,F,"    After closing the front door shut, I looked up to see this very sad look on my Daughters face, she was crying. I didnt think for one minute she was dead. I told her to come down off the stairs and she just looked at me blankly, pleadingly. That look will haunt me all my life. It was then I noticed my dressing gown belt, which was made of a silk like material around her neck. Reflecting back on this, I realise now that the stitches had broken so this had stretched giving the illusion, Tracey was standing on the stairs, leaning against the wall.    Thinking she was unconscious but alive, I realised by locking the door, I had locked out any chance of help from neighbours. I asked my little girl to go in the kitchen and get a chair. Put it near the bench and stand on it. On the top of the cabinets above, there are some scissors, bring them to me?    Bless her, she done everything asked of her while I held Tracey from her own weight. My little boy cried and cried and cried in a panic and was too young to understand the urgency what was going on around him other than he knew there was something very wrong.     I cut my Daughter free, called 999 then started Life saving techniques. I did have the support of the emergency service by phone.

2590,ME ,1406,55,,M,"  In 1954 I was born in Astoria Queens, NYC and brought up in the Diocese of Brooklyn. I attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel School and Church. My family moved to Northern New Jersey and I finished my Catholic School in Immaculate Conception in Franklin NJ Diocese of Patterson. To my parents credit one can see where the foundation of my Catholic Faith was formed. I was dragged to church. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there so eventually when I was old enough I left. I lived a very sinful life. One can only imagine where I was but I was not with God. I joined the Navy and began to become an adult and my world did not include God. Things happened to me that in retrospect God must have chose me for better things because my Guardian Angle was very busy.  I met Protestants, while in the Navy. These people were FIRED UP FOR THE LORD. They were obnoxious thumping their Bibles. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them. Finally in 1975 I associated with them enough that in Key West Baptist Church I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. The evil one still had a hold on me and I soon returned to my secular and sinful way of life. As we headed east for Desert Storm in 1990 there were definately more Christians than I have ever seen on an Aircraft Carrier before in my life. History is what it is with that war. Prayer works. Never doubt it.   I did get married to Paula in 1982 in St. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s Church in Sussex NJ. We had a good life as a Navy couple. We attended Mass sometimes mostly non-denominational services. For some reason I developed an attitude toward the Catholic Church.  I retired from the Navy in 1999 and by 2003 we found ourselves in Warrenton VA attending the Warrenton Presbyterian Church. Make no mistake the Pastor and congregation of Warrenton Presbyterian are blessed people. I had attended a Methodist Church for a couple of years, while living in NY so going to church now in my life became a necessary event. But I still was not dedicated to it. I had a Protestant perspective on forgiveness, which is what the Bible says happens if we repent; That is what I was taught by Protestants, however it still is not the teaching of the Catholic Church.  Life was good life was bad. I had some financial difficulties with other obstacles in life and I earnestly prayed to God that he help me get my life in order. Paula and I by the grace of Divine Providence found St. John the Evangelist church in Warrenton VA about 2006. It reminded us of our old time Catholic up bringing and we both felt like re returned home. We stayed.   Now in 2012 at age 57 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to back track. At age 54 or 55 I attended Mass during Easter. Father Cozy discussed the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Saint Faustina. I thought it was interesting that all one had to do was say this chaplet for salvation. Fr. Cozy had planted one of the larger mustard seeds of faith in me, no doubt. As a government contractor my customer was the Navy. I was able to walk the walk and talk the talk with Sailors so I excelled at my job (at least I thought I did). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I was age 55 that I bought my copy of St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary. I had to ride two large deck helicopter and aircraft carriers in a month\xe2\x80\x99s time so my travel to west coast gave me plenty of time to read the diary. I read through St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary like a novel. I eventually realized this was a 20th Century Saint talking directly to me. She was talking directly to me! Through Providence I started saying one Hail Mary a day also eventually this lead up to a full Rosary. I guess the door with no doorknob on my heart was being opened to Jesus. Things started to happen. While on one of the ships I shared a stateroom with two Harrier Pilots. They were both Catholic and noticed what I was reading. We shared some fellowship. I finished the Diary and it was like there was a bonus CD in the back of the book. The bonus was St. Faustina stayed with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say apparition in this essay, but I will say \xe2\x80\x9cheightened spiritual awareness.\xe2\x80\x9d I had this sense Sister was with me. I attended my first Divine Mercy Service that Easter and completed the novena prior to that. I was able to venerate and kiss a first class relic of St. Faustina during the service a woman had and shared with us all. It was about this time in May that I was coming home form work. I pulled in my driveway and was gathering my wits when in my interior voice. The interior voice! In my interior voice from nowhere I heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice say thank you. The voice was so beautiful and melodic. It could only be associated with Our Blessed Mother. I paused and took it in. Hopefully I said a prayer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember but I probably did.

2600,OBE,1229,44,,M,"Almost immediately after taking the divine plant I began to fall out of my body. It was a wholly new sensation for me. After years of pursuing the actual out of body occurrence it was nothing as I had imagined it to be. There is noting that can compare one for the actual sensation. During numerous mediations I had always imagined myself rising above my body to look down and view myself. But this is not what actually happened. I actually fell into myself. I literally fell out of myself and by falling inside myself. And then instantly found myself floating above my body laying on the bed. The experience of being pulled out of the body was not an unpleasant sensation rather it was the first time to feel it and all firsts are usually associated with some fear. In this case it happened so fast and the train I was on had no exit routes, so I was on it for the duration. Once I was above my body the experience was quite pleasant. I was amazed at how I looked. I also notice the family cat was aware of my presence which I found quite interesting as it gazed upon my astral body. Just as I was becoming acquainted with my new surroundings I was yanked yet again in another direction at an astounding rate through a tunnel towards a light. Upon reaching the end of the tunnel I seemed to be deposited on the other side of a threshold. This place was completely and utterly spectacular. I was suddenly connected to everything was the feeling I remember most. I only needed to think of something and the associated response was with me. The communication was so much different here. I wasnt thinking in words but pictures associated with strong feelings and emotions. And I was like a newborn. I had very little experience in this new environment. It was very much a fish out of water experience. The thing that left the most lasting impression on me was this. I was able to look back on where I had just come from. The physical world. It was close. I could perceive it clearly as if it were a separate dimension but very close. I began to focus on the edges of it as it didnt seem to be wholly formed yet. The colors were so vibrant and alive.  So organic. The edges looked like caviar. And It came into me that I was perceiving the physical on a molecular level. I was so amazed. Then suddenly it came through me like a lightening bolt. These molecules perceived me. They were aware I was looking at them. Communication!! Images and information passed at an alarming rate. I was aware of the rythme and reason for everything coming into being. It filled me with a sense of joy I had never felt before. I laughed. I knew what life really was. These small bits of life....molecules...all formed based on collective thoughts. We all were creating everyday. We just didnt realize how powerful our thoughts we were. Then I was aware of a presence behind me. It was so brite and so large. My first thoughts were not of intrigue but of how small and dim I was. And just this tiny bit of hesitation flooded me with thoughts of....had I killed myself. Suddenly I was flooded with thoughts of fear. I wanted to know if I was alive. I yearned to feel my body again. So I prayed to feel my body again. And I was propelled in that direction. It was not an easy maneuver. It took some time to anchor myself in my body but it was accomplished. I had set up a timer on the side of the night stand. Total duration was 15 minutes. It had felt like an eternity. There was actually no sensation of time where I had gone. It did not exist.

He asked me which aspect I had chosen and I told him. We walked over to where that Priestess was working. She had someone there and I was told to wait. She would tell me to come over to her when she was ready. She raised her hand and waved me over. I knelt at her feet. I felt an amazing amount of energy around me, it was actually quite warm. I was wearing a cloak but had to remove it. I didnt look at her face. A voice spoke and asked me what I wished to know. Her voice was clear, calm, and so beautiful. I asked for clarity in the coming years. If there was anything I needed to know or was missing. I could feel her smile. I had my eyes closed. The next thing I felt was her hand on my forehead. An amazing amount of energy surged through me and I felt like I had been drenched in love energy. I began to cry. I never felt so accepted, understood, and knew that no matter what I did or choices I made, I was loved and would always be her daughter. I wept. Such unconditional love completely overwhelmed me. Once we finished, the attendant came to help me up and I continued to cry all the way back up the path. He held me and we walked to the upper fire where a chair was waiting. He sat me down and got me some apple juice to drink. He told me to wait there until I could walk back to my camp unaided. Once I got back to camp, I kept crying for several hours.

I had only been married about 6 months, and I was beginning to realize that perhaps I had made a mistake marrying this man...that he wasnt all that in love with me. A few days earlier, I had said a prayer and asked if this was all there was to marriage and asked for help from God even though I want sure if there really was a God.  A few days later, I was asleep next to my husband. And I felt like I was having a dream with this bright light appearing.

2613,DEE,1293,61,,F,"On August 20, 2006, Holy Spirit visited me. I was creating beaded jewelry that I sold at different outlets. I had finished a line of bracelets and cleared off my beading table, and put away all my beads, to make room for a new line of bracelets I wanted to make. I walked away from the table but when I returned, I saw in the middle of the cleaned-off area a Christian cross made up of small, clear glass pebbles. You know, the kind that are rounded on one side and flat on the other side. I liked these clear glass pebbles and kept a glass of them on my beading table to look at and to play with. The cross was positioned on the table askew--1:00 / 7:00. The lines of the glass pebbled cross were absolutely perfectly straight. The long part of the cross was made up of all one side of the pebbles while the short part was made up of the other side. I stood there and just stared at the glass cross. For the first few seconds, I was in a mild state of shock. I searched my brain to see if I had done that and forgot, but no. I thought if Hank might have done it but didnt think he would have. Then I knew where it came from and got the chills. But I had to eliminate Hank just to be sure, so I called him in. I pointed to the cross and asked if he did this. He stared at the cross and said no. I told him I didnt do it either. I told him that Holy Spirit did it. He didnt say anything about this. We looked at it some more and then went back to work. I tried to Crazy Glue the glass pebbles together to keep it as it was but the round glass pebbles wouldnt hold together even with this glue. The glue residue dirtied up the pretty clear glass pebbles (as you can see in the uploaded image) but I didnt want to clean them off. I wanted to keep them as they were. I put the pebbles in a pretty silk sack and kept it together with my other Signs from God. I went to my spiritual journal and recorded this experience, like I did with all the others.

2619,NDE,1388,54,,M,"Bam!  That had to be a plane, I thought to myself. Nothing else could possibly be moving that fast. The force of the impact had snapped the drivers seat off and I felt the car being catapulted forward. That in itself was alarming.  I had been traveling north on I-75 just north of Atlanta, GA and had just been readying to exit the North Marietta Loop traveling at about 60 mph when the impact from behind had occurred. Just a couple minutes prior I had seen some jets taking off from Dobbins Air Base. It wasnt a plane that hit me though. It was an uninsured 19 yr old driving an unregistered vehicle. Witness reports put his speed at over a 100 mph as he wove in and out of traffic coming up I-75.  The impact caused the back end of my car to jerk out to the right. The wheels on my Toyata Corolla seemed to grab the road surface. I could feel the car begin to turn over. I knew how fast I was going. I knew the car would be turning over and over in a wild tumble. It was without a doubt one of those entire life in a flash moments. There wasnt a lot of time for any lengthy reminiscing though.  Just two thoughts went through my mind. The first was a pondering why Divine Spirit had chosen this time for me. Wow, I really thought Ive learned a lot in this life. Im just at the point in life where I might be able to offer others something worthwhile. Why now?  The second thought was expressed in a spirit of surrendering, God, I really only have one request. Id really like to take all that Ive learned with me to my next life. Please dont require me to learn everything all over again. Reincarnation is something that Im completely familiar and comfortable with.  The car began to flip over. I could hear the metal shearing and the glass shattering all around me. I felt the tumbling effect. I felt like I was inside a long tunnel like whirlpool. In the center of that incredibly fast spinning darkness I saw a bright white light, warm like the sun, very quiet and very serene.  Total silence.  I opened my eyes. Cool, I thought. I made it through this and Im not even hurt! No pain at all!  Then I tried to move. Not so much as a finger responded. I was lying face down, head in the back seat, my feet somewhere up around the area of the steering wheel. A thumb was pressing hard against my nose and lip. I could see that it appeared, by its relative positioning, to be the thumb from my left hand, but it was my right thumb. I could also see that my right arm bent in an awkward position under my throat. God, Im glad Im paralyzed because that would really hurt if I could feel it, I said to myself.  Totally paralyzed, I thought to myself. Quadriplegic. I will be a burden on everyone for the rest of my life.  I then concluded that because I was unable to feel any pain, that I probably had serious internal injuries as well. I would die here, but at least I would die without pain. I thanked Divine Spirit for that blessing.  I could literally feel myself, as Spirit, sinking slowly down and out of my body. It was a deeply sickening feeling. Then I heart a tapping sound. Are you all right? a womans trembling voice asked.  Im paralyzed. Call the police, call the ambulance. I said. At least I could talk, I thought to myself.  That started a flurry of activity. Over the next half hour, I heard sirens, people yelling and screaming, and the unmistakable sound of a helicopter. All the while I laid face down, head in the back seat, not moving. All the doors were jammed. The parameds were frantically trying to reach me and couldnt. They kept saying, Stay with us now, stay with us. They ended up cutting off the entire roof of the car and very carefully they lifted me out. I was placed on a stretcher, moved to level ground, and was immediately given an IV.  At least 5 or 6 medical personal surrounded me. The one directly above my face said to me, Mr., youre going to be all right. Then a womans voice said, Mr., have you made arrangements for organ transplants?  Yeah, I said. Its on my drivers license. I could see the guy directly above me stare down the lady who said it.  Then another voice spoke up. Mr, do you have a living will?  No, I said. I looked up at the guy above me and said, Im in it pretty deep, huh?  He smiled down at me and said Id be fine. Yeah, right, I thought to myself.  They strapped me in the lifeflight helicopter. Off I went to the Atlanta Medical Center Spinal Trauma Unit, the best such facility for hundreds of miles in all directions. Upon arriving I was placed in the operating room recovery room. Apparently there was more room there for all the medical personnel to gather round me.  After being taken for CAT Scans and an MRI I was returned to the recovery room. After the initial blur of activity, another seriously injured person was brought into the room. She was obviously near death. The doctors",,    Q.

2620,ADC,1394,49,,F,"Terry Dean                         1946-2012 Terry was a well-known and dedicated musician in the Overberg and Hermanus. Terry\xe2\x80\x99s battle with cancer started in 2007-where it was diagnosed in the colon. He was successfully operated on in September that year and recovered, remaining healthy until March 2009, when a tumour was removed from his small intestine. He received chemotherapy at Tygerberg Hospital afterwards and seemed well. He continued to play his gigs-he said the music took his mind away from the pain. His last gig was just after New Year 2012 at the Shuntin\xe2\x80\x99 Shed in Bot River-but he was very weak by then.  The last six months of his life, he was cared for at home-with the help of Hospice. Terry slipped into a coma on Thursday 28th June-I spoke to him and told him it was alright to move on, that his daughters T&#232;gan and Tullia, and I, would be fine. I also asked him to send me a sign when he crossed over. He passed away in the early hours of Friday morning. He was smiling. I knew he had left us, and in the early winter morning, I looked out of the window up at the grey sky-completely overcast except for a very defined sliver of blue sky- in the perfect shape of an electric guitar. I was so grateful for that sign. Terry had asked a good friend of his to sell his beloved Fender Telecaster (which he bought in America) to help support his family-as he had been unable to work for months. I was told that the lady who bought it was called Tracy; and she had bought it for her partner, John, whom we had never met, as they live near Johannesburg. The morning of Terry\xe2\x80\x99s passing; I received a call from Tracy, enquiring how Terry was. I told her that he had passed away in the early hours of that morning. She gave me condolences and put John on the phone. This is what he told me: On the night in question, at about 11:45 p.m. my very faithful dog, Sasha, nudged me with her nose and would not stop...until I got out of bed. I was at my farm, not far from Hartebeespoort Dam at the time. Only to find Sasha sitting next to the Fender case... I made a cup of coffee, called my dog to the kitchen and she would not budge. I know that it sounds weird, but, I had to play the telecaster... my dog left the room as soon as I plugged the guitar into the amp... played a few bars of John Lee Hooker and went to bed. As you know I phoned you the next morning to offer my condolences... how I knew that?... your Terry was with me, of that I am sure... I feel that he has been back, too often I find myself compelled to play the tele. Bear in mind, I have seven other guitars, all very good... but the tele keeps calling...??? The guitar is well and safe... I play the smoke out of it and love the mood it leaves me with... I am sure you understand what I mean by that. In any case, I have no opinion on the life here after, but, Terry Dean was with me and wanted to hear me play, to see if I was up to scratch, I think?

2634,ME ,1287,57,,F,"On January 12, 2002 something pivotal happened that enabled me to open my mind to believe in God. My husband Hank and I were staying at a historic, antique-filled bed and breakfast, Butternut Farm, in Glastonbury, Connecticut. (I dont think the owners of this establishment would want it to be made public that their bed and breakfast is haunted.) It was Saturday night and we went to sleep on the comfortable and luxurious bed. In the middle of the night, I woke up, eyes wide open, and sat up tall in bed. Looking back on this experience, I must have looked like I was in one of those movies when someone is under a spell and rises from their sleep with their eyes wide open, back straight as a board. I didnt hear or smell anything and I wasnt touched by anything but I instantly turned my head to the left and saw something. About three feet away from me, suspended in mid air about eye level to me, was a ghost. The ghost was shaped like a huge, round, horizontal Bayer aspirin tablet. It was flat on the top and bottom with rounded edges. It was about two feet in diameter. The ghost was made up of thousands of tiny black particles, each shaped like a sperm, which furiously rotated clockwise as fast as a tornado. It spun around so violently that it spewed off some of the tiny black particles. But, although the ghost was just a couple of feet away and although it was spinning as fast as a tornado, I didnt feel a breeze and none of the particles touched me. It was as if the ghost was contained in its own little world, separate from my human world. This whole experience actually lasted just a few seconds, because as soon as I sat up and turned my head and my eyes saw the ghost, as if it saw me looking at it, it instantly broke down into an amoebic mob of black particles and made a mad dash for the closed old door and disappeared through the long crack of the warped frame. I sat up for a while thinking about this experience. Strangely, I did not feel fear because if I did, I would have awakened my husband. I did feel a sort of fear because I didnt want to put my head back down on the pillow, afraid to go back to sleep, afraid the ghost would return. But I was very tired and layed back down to ponder what I should do. The next thing I knew, it was morning. As soon as we woke up, I told Hank about the ghost. He just listened to me. He looked like he was believing me. I told him there probably was a small chance it was all a dream but I didnt think so. It didnt feel like a dream. It felt real and I remembered it in vivid detail. When we went downstairs for breakfast, I was so excited that I told everyone in the dining room what happened to me that night. The two owners mockingly pooh-poohed my story but there was a visiting pastor from Pennsylvania. She also stayed overnight because she was to give a sermon at a nearby church. She confirmed that she was also visited by the ghost. She said she didnt see what I saw but she woke up during the night and felt its presence sitting in a chair by her bed. She said that in her line of work, people often came to her with stories and issues concerning ghosts and spirits. With the pastor as witness, I was validated 100% that I did indeed see a ghost. Actually, I think this pastor was an Angel because in the days ahead I tried to reach her but I couldnt find her anywhere, even though she gave me her business card. It was as if she disappeared. Seeing the ghost was a shocking but crucial experience. It had served a greater purpose in my life than just to amaze me. It took about a year for me to digest and process the ghost before I could tell anyone else. Then I told a friend. After getting this experience out, I started to really think about the ghost. It suddenly dawned on me that I saw a ghost! The reality of seeing a ghost, I realized, became proof that there really was a spiritual world. Standing now on the threshold of this whole new world, my mind looked out and wondered: Wow! Now that I know there really is a spiritual world and that ghosts are real, what else can I believe in? The answer came in my very next breath: God. But, still, I didnt find God for another year. And on that day, everything became crystal clear.

I was told (not verbally/audibly, but there was a consious awareness of communication, and understanding, perhaps telepathic) that I was loved. In this darkness I felt every cell of my body bathed in peace and love and comfort. No pain, not a euphoria, but just simply wonderful. It felt so good. But then I realized I had a choice to move forward to (I assumed heaven) or go back to where I had been. As good as this place made me feel, I thought about how cute my new baby sone was and how I wanted to be his mother. As soon as my choice was clear, I felt my self beamed back instantly to the hospital bed. I remember saying to the nurses, Im back.

2641,DEE,1293,61,,F,"On August 20, 2006, Holy Spirit visited me. I was creating beaded jewelry that I sold at different outlets. I had finished a line of bracelets and cleared off my beading table, and put away all my beads, to make room for a new line of bracelets I wanted to make. I walked away from the table but when I returned, I saw in the middle of the cleaned-off area a Christian cross made up of small, clear glass pebbles. You know, the kind that are rounded on one side and flat on the other side. I liked these clear glass pebbles and kept a glass of them on my beading table to look at and to play with. The cross was positioned on the table askew--1:00 / 7:00. The lines of the glass pebbled cross were absolutely perfectly straight. The long part of the cross was made up of all one side of the pebbles while the short part was made up of the other side. I stood there and just stared at the glass cross. For the first few seconds, I was in a mild state of shock. I searched my brain to see if I had done that and forgot, but no. I thought if Hank might have done it but didnt think he would have. Then I knew where it came from and got the chills. But I had to eliminate Hank just to be sure, so I called him in. I pointed to the cross and asked if he did this. He stared at the cross and said no. I told him I didnt do it either. I told him that Holy Spirit did it. He didnt say anything about this. We looked at it some more and then went back to work. I tried to Crazy Glue the glass pebbles together to keep it as it was but the round glass pebbles wouldnt hold together even with this glue. The glue residue dirtied up the pretty clear glass pebbles (as you can see in the uploaded image) but I didnt want to clean them off. I wanted to keep them as they were. I put the pebbles in a pretty silk sack and kept it together with my other Signs from God. I went to my spiritual journal and recorded this experience, like I did with all the others. Now I keep these pebbles out in the open in the shape of the cross on a plate with my DAD envelope next to it.

I was shopping alone in my local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, buying stuff and yet another set of bed linens because I didnt have that particular shade of beige. I suddenly stopped walking and looked down at all the stuff in my cart and felt a longing. I thought to myself, Is this it? Is this all there is to life? That Peggy Lee song came into my head: Is That All There Is? I just stood there, in that store, staring at all my stuff in the cart, and feeling a strong yearning to find a deeper meaning to life. I wasnt thinking to find God yet. I just wanted to know a deeper meaning to life. I couldnt believe that life was just about cooking dinners, buying bed linens and sending people greeting cards. I didnt realize then that I wanted to find God. The funny and ironic part of this story is that God planted this second seed (the first seed had to do with Rose Kennedys face, which Ill submit soon) at the store called Bed, Bath and BEYOND. A girlfriend brought this irony to my attention, which I didnt get at the time of the STE. At the moment that my STE occurred, I told myself that I was going to find a deeper meaning in life.

We just looked at each other for a moment after that. In the dream, I felt a little confused. But I reached to hug my loved ones brother and said, Hugging you is like hugging Bob. Then we hugged and after that he dissapeared and the dream was over.  After I woke up, I remembered the dream very clearly. But, just like I was confused in the dream, I was confused when I first woke up. I thought to myself, What does he mean that what I want is overwhelming for Bob? Then I remembered that I had asked for the sign in the form of a particular song. I was stunned.  It was like my loved one sent his brother to tell me he couldnt give me that particular sign because it was too overwhelming. And to this day, though I have received many signs from my loved one, I never have heard this song playing anywhere! I guess it really is overwhelming!

2665,OBE,1371,26,,M,"What I observed, felt and saw were the most real things I ever experienced. As I slept, I didnt just float away I shot off like a rocket. I was going warp speed with a destination pre-programmed. I didnt know consciously where I was headed, I just knew I was going. It was very much the sensation of flying through space. It was dark like space, but I dont remember darkness. I do recall zooming past worlds, orbs really, not planets in the physical sense, but worlds nonetheless, near and far. I traveled at this warp speed what I could sense was a vast distance, multitudes beyond what we even have measurements for. When I came out of my travels, I found myself in the presence of these two men as described above.  And HERE is the most remarkable, profound, and intense part of this experience: Despite their important work of apparently saving a large population, when I arrived there, they both turned their full attention to me. Here, words truly lose their meaning. I have great reverence for these two men and the work they were seemingly doing, yet despite this they afforded me their full attention and admiration and love. They were happy to see ME! But it was so much more than that. I felt all of the infinite and unconditional love of the universe, the acceptance, everything Dr. Eben discussed in his book, if I may use that cop-out in lieu of attempting to describe the indescribable.  At the time, I had been dealing with being disrespected as a new EMT in a culture that big on attitude and tradition and small on respect. I learned one of the most important lessons of my life in that moment: That every being on earth is greeted with %1,000 full attention, love, admiration, and acceptance by God, with no regard to anything else thats going on. I cant fathom how its possible to everywhere and doing everything at once, despite the fact that I experienced beings capable of that while making me the center and sole focus of all that infinite love.  I clumsily and, I feel, stupidly introduced myself as Josh, from Oregon, as though that would have made sense. It did, apparently. As we all floated above this world with refugees down below, information was exchanged. There was a discussion. I do not recall nor did I upon waking- that discussion that was shared between the three of us. I was there to experience what I had upon my arrival. My mother, whom I was best friends with, died in 2002. My family was shattered, but I was the apple of my mothers eye. Her death is something that I still havent dealt with fully. I sense that this was at the heart of that exchange, however it was with some other part of me that I dont have access to right now.  When this conversation concluded, whatever it was, I remember making the journey back to my body. It was the exact same immeasurable distance, yet the time it took was very... well, there was no quick or slow about it. It just was. When I arrived back to my body, I snapped awake.  I immediately called my father who had been close friends with Pir Vilayat. My dad was very supportive and receptive, even happy that I had such a special dream.

2666,ME ,1431,28,,F,"It was a warm July evening in 2010. I had two 8month-old twin daughters at the time. I got an invitation for a dinner with friends and spent the evening with them. My husband was at home with the girls. I was walking home after the dinner. It was already dark and the city lights were on. I was walking on a deserted street alone when a car passed me. Young men were sitting in it, hearing loud music. I did not really pay attention to them and turned into another street, which was much darker. Suddenly a really strong invisible force hit me, and I staggered into a dark corner near a house. I almost fell, and was shocked. 2 seconds later the same car with the young men appeared in the street. This time they were driving very slowly as if they were looking for something/someone. They could not see me, as I was still in the dark corner of a house. They passed me again, this time the music was off. I realized later that they must have been looking for me. I struggled to get myself together in the corner where I was still crouching. I was shocked because it was clearly not me, who decided to hide in the corner. It was as if someone/something had hit me or shoved me there. I went home at last but I have not told anybody about this experience for a long time, not even my husband.

2670,ME ,1270,29,,F,"In 1974 I was 29 years of age. (I am now 67 years of age.) I was feeling pretty despondent at that time, having spent four years trying to make a living as a visual fine artist in Manhattan but not succeeding. Not knowing how else to support myself, I enlisted in the Army. But as the day of my enlistment grew near, I was becoming increasingly anxious and fearful. I was a free spirit and knew I would hate losing my freedom and someone else telling me what to do. But if I didnt go, I didnt know how else to take care of myself. I did not want to go back to secretarial work, not after I fell in love with art. I was stuck in a tight spot.  Three days before the big day, I was sitting on my hotel bed. I had given up my apartment in Little Italy and took a room for 3 months in a midtown Manhattan hotel. I was just staring out into my room, not knowing which way to turn. It was daytime. With the suddenness of a light switch just turned on, a brilliant white, round glow with a more brilliant Christian cross embedded in the middle of the glow appeared before my eyes. The vision was suspended in mid air. The glow and cross were about ten inches tall and sat about eight feet in front of me, a little lower than my eye level. The light that emanated from the glow was contained. There werent any rays coming from it. The whole cross fit totally within the glow. The cross was a plain, elegant cross with no detail. The ends of the narrow vertical and horizontal bars were cut straight across. (This vision was entirely visual. I didnt feel, smell or hear anything.) Although the glow and cross were as intensely bright as a flame, I stared easily into it. I wasnt afraid by its presence or doubted what was before my eyes. I never said to myself, What is this? or Why is a Christian cross coming to me? I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish. Actually, my mind was blank, without any thoughts. But I was transfixed by this sight, spiritually locked into it. I was aware that the glow and cross were calming me down, making me feel peaceful and serene. I think I was staring at it for a short period of time, maybe 15 minutes.  I remember how the glow and cross came on but I dont remember how it went away. After staring at it, I think I put my head down on a pillow and went to sleep. But the strange thing is that when I awoke, not only wasnt the vision still there but I didnt even remember that I saw it. Actually, I didnt remember this event until 30 years later, when I was sitting in my car experiencing my epiphany, which I talked about in my February 23 submission to you. Looking back at that time, the glow and cross did not tell me if I should go into the Army or not. What this vision did was to calm me down, relax me and relieve me of a paralyzing anxiety which was keeping me from seeing clearly and making the right decision for myself. Relaxed and clear thinking, I made the easy decision to withdraw from my Army enlistment. I went to the Army base and explained how I felt.

I hesitated scared I remember and said Im not ready. Then snap I was lying down again and opened my eyes. The room was exactly how I saw it through them closed other than the beings were gone. I felt like I knew these people intimately more than the people I know in this world even though I couldnt see them I sensed they were close to me like family like my real family. I felt I could trust them but that I hadnt completed my purposes on earth yet. I was in effect asking for more time.

I told my husband that he should read the article because it was so unusual, but he said he would read it in the morning. He never did. Within a couple of weeks, he had a motorcycle accident and was killed instantly.

I had only been married about 6 months, and I was beginning to realize that perhaps I had made a mistake marrying this man...that he wasnt all that in love with me. A few days earlier, I had said a prayer and asked if this was all there was to marriage and asked for help from God even though I want sure if there really was a God.  A few days later, I was asleep next to my husband. And I felt like I was having a dream with this bright light appearing. It was the brightest light I had ever seen...almost a piercing blue white light. I opened my eyes and realized this was not a dream at all! I looked into my closest where the doors were open and out of the left back side of the closest, the light radiated from. I wasnt scared...actually it was quite comforting. I quickly woke my husband up. He couldnt believe what he was seeing either. I kept saying, what is it? Is this real or are we imaging it. We both just sat there for about a minute staring at the light. Again, it was the brightest light I had ever seen but, the light didnt radiate throughout the room but stayed concentrated in the closest. After it disappeared, I just continued to sit up in bed trying to figure out what had just happened. Then, out of the blue, I began speaking in a language that I had never heard. My husband heard me, and thought I was going crazy. I had no idea what was happening. It wasnt scary....just really weird. This continued non stop for about 3 hours until I was completely exhausted and went to sleep at about 6am that am. When I woke up, I was completely perplexed as to what just happened to me. I decided I needed to go talk to someone about this so I went and visited with my priest at the Episcopal church at the time. He tried to explain it but, I was still perplexed as I had never heard of speaking I tongues, nor had I asked to have that given to me.

2682,ADC,1187,43,,F,"One night after Cloy\xe2\x80\x99s funeral I was lying in my bed in the middle of the night unable to sleep. I was experiencing incredible deep agonizing emotional pain. I had left a church that I knew wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true and I had been ostracized by family and friends for doing so. I was divorced and felt so alone in the world as a single mother. I was curled up in a ball, hugging my knees closely to my chest. I always shook when I cried. It was as if something was trying to shake loose inside of me to finally be free, but it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make its way out, and so I was strangling, squirming for spiritual air. I cried and trembled. Suddenly something other-wordly occurred. I saw Cloy at the end of the hallway. She came towards me into my room. I recognized her because of her outer form. I say outer form because she was translucent, yet color filled, if that makes any sense. I could see through her, yet I could recognize completely that it was her. As she came towards me I said in exclamation, Cloy!\xe2\x80\x9d  It is difficult to describe what happened after that because words cannot describe what occurred next. There simply are no words on this planet for it. All that I can say is that Cloy somehow filled me with what she feels wherever she now is. Suddenly I felt as if someone had placed a needle about two to three inches long in each and every pore over my entire body, starting at the top of my head and ending with the bottom of my toes. The needles had something in them that was the essence of pure unadulterated ecstasy. It was a joy that I have never felt in this earthly existence, and I am certain that it does not exist at the earthly level of vibrational being. The needles tingled full of warm bubbly unconditional love. It was Christmas and Valentines and Halloween all in one. It was chocolate kisses and truffles and the sweet nectar of watercress fresh out of the mountain spring. It was children\xe2\x80\x99s laughter and hugs and unity squared. I was in a state of complete euphoria and exultation that I have never before or since experienced. I was involuntarily smiling from ear to ear. I could feel myself smiling, but it was not me doing it. Seconds before I had been in utter agony. Now, I was so overcome with happiness, that the smile on my face felt permanent. I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not smiling I am being smiled!\xe2\x80\x9d  I lay in the midst of this pleasure and rapture as the needles continued to tingle and pour warm, pure, syrupy, liquid affection into my veins. The veins carried it swiftly to my major organs and I breathed tender compassion. My blood became a river of sweet adulation. I then realized that if there were a drug that could reproduce that feeling \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d be on it twenty-four-seven. As a social worker dealing with methamphetamine users, I had wondered why in the world these people would take drugs and lose everything for it. Instantaneously I knew the answer. I mean, if it feels anything like what I felt that night, I can understand why someone would sell their soul for it. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this feeling was ethereal from another realm. I could only guess that Cloy was aware of my secret agony and she was giving me the ecstatic feeling that is constantly present wherever she is to assuage my pain. The message of the feeling was one of (and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to say this in words because it was conveyed to me beyond words \xe2\x80\x93 it was communicated soul to soul, mind to mind \xe2\x80\x93 words just cheapen it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how else to describe it except with words) \xe2\x80\x9cJane, you are loved unconditionally and you are OK just the way you are.

There is only love.\xe2\x80\x9d   I closed my eyes and luxuriated in the heavenly tingling. Eventually it subsided.

I wasnt paying particular attention to anything and was letting my mind wander when I gradually realized that I was flying, not flying in the airplane, but flying alongside the airplane. It was a wonderful feeling, like the flying dreams that I used to have as a child. The difference was that in my childhood dreams, my body was flying and...and I was asleep. When I was on the airplane, I wasnt sleeping. What happened was that I was listening to the music and then I became aware that I was flying in spirit.

2704,NDE,1398,32,,F,"I remember a feeling of being sucked out of my body, sort of like separating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with all the stickiness and resistance. After I was completely separated I was observing from above as they were performing CPR and attaining IV access. The doctor put my body in Trudelenburg position. At this point, my attention is drawn away by a feeling that someone was calling me. My attention became focused on this sparkling light, I want to call it a warm glowing light but it is hard to describe because the physical sensation of warmth was not really present. As soon as I acknowledged this light, I was just in it. There were these rainbow orbs that spoke to me and there were people there in what I was communicated to be a sort of holding room. I didnt see anything other than people and orbs in this room that went on for what seemed like an eternity without walls or ceiling. Soon after, I remember laughing but not laughing like in a physical sense, but, in any case, laughing with the people in the room. It was like I ran into old friends and we just picked right back where we left off type of feeling. I dont really have a sense of time of how long I was there but I was guided to another location and there was a woman there who said that I was going to be experiencing what I termed a rewrite. This is so hard to put into words but she communicated to me that a different course was available to me if I so chose to follow it. I felt like everything was more real than anything I had ever experienced, so alive, so intelligent, so revealed. The woman was near a mountain, at the base of it in a vivacious green meadow. We sat for a while but I cannot put into words the things I learned, I dont even remember what I had learned until I come across events in my life that trigger the knowledge that was given to me. I know it sounds strange but it makes sense to me. I was given a choice. You can stay or you can go back. I remember asking questions, like, go back where? And as soon as I asked that question, I knew where. I dont think the complete question even came forth before the answer was already being revealed. This is when I could hear conversations going on. I could hear the people in my ICU room. Complete conversations. I became saddened and wanted to see but I was informed that I had to choose first. I heard my son crying, begging me to open my eyes. My attention went to the woman, her eyes were crystal clear pale blue eyes and she had long dark hair, dressed in a sort of plain creamy colored garb. She never spoke sound words, it was telepathic thoughts. She revealed different life traumas I had experienced up to that point; I was wondering why only the traumas and not the good times, and just as I had that thought the answer was that it serves a purpose and that purpose comes to me at different times since my near death. I also heard my mothers prayers and the prayers of others pleading for my health and wellness. I recall leaving the woman in the field and I just seemed to float away...into space...and it felt as if though I had rushed millions maybe even billions of miles away in seconds. I seen these other worlds and other peoples only to be drawn back in a flash to the holding room. It was time for me to decide and it seemed urgent; will I accept the rewrite or stay where I was; there was no right or wrong choice. Only my choice. I longed for my children, knowing that things would be very different in a bad way if I chose to stay. I was communicated that my road to recovery would be hard at first, but would get easier as time went by. It was hard for me to conceive how this time would be if I returned. I felt drawn back and chose to go back all the while knowing it was going to be difficult. As soon as I made the choice, the people in the holding room became ecstatic and exuberant and I thought this was the strangest occurrence of the whole ordeal. I all of a sudden felt the most unbearable discomfort, my body. I tried to open my eyes and couldnt, I felt the loudness of my heart beating at an unthinkable speed, I immediately came back out of my body and hovered over it for a moment before entering again. The next thing I remember is the nurses and doctor in the ICU room asking me to stay calm because I was connected to a ventilator. My hands were secured to restraints. I couldnt focus my eyes when I first came back, I had been in a coma for 9 days. I had apparently became septic after surgery and went into septic shock. On entering the ICU on July 1, 2002, I slipped into a coma, they intubated me, and there I lay dying until July 9th, my daughters birthday.

2707,OBE,1531,30,,F,"I must first start out by explaining that I have had OBEs my entire life, beginning when I was about 9 or 10 years old. It was at this age that I began watching tv programs about people being visited by their guardian angels, or other such spirits, who had saved their lives, or sent these people messages of some monumental significance.  I was very much affected by these programs and began praying to god, or to whoever was listening to me, for some sign of the \xe2\x80\x98other side,\xe2\x80\x99 because I knew deep inside that there was more to life and I wanted to experience it firsthand as these other people did. I prayed every day obsessively and even created my own Ouija board out of paper and a ring, thinking I could make some sort of connection. The ring did eventually move, to my astonishment, but it was just my own energy that I was becoming aware of. So I began to feel my own energy throughout my body, as I do to this day, although for some time I believed it was a spirit taking over my body because it felt so foreign at the time, and as a young child I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better.  Shortly after being aware of my own energy I began to feel my energy leave my body at night when I was falling asleep.  It was incredibly startling and disturbing, as it would jolt me awake, just as I was beginning to fall asleep. As I would awaken my energy would immediately slam back into my body. As a child I thought this was the devil taking my soul away, and I used to cry and pray to god at night. This happened all the time, and it was very frightening, and there was no one I could tell because I knew I would sound crazy. One night when I was crying and praying, I suddenly felt \xe2\x80\x93and had the image of- someone kissing my cheek. I felt the energy touch my face and sink into my skin- and then I felt an immense, overwhelming wave of intense love encompass my entire body, and I knew in my soul that I was loved and taken care of, that I was perfectly safe. I was in complete shock, and my tears turned to tears of joy- someone had responded to my prayers! I knew I was going to be ok! Somehow whatever was happening to me at night was not as horrible as I thought it was\xe2\x80\xa6and so I let it happen, knowing I was protected. I was so stunned by what happened-I had truly made a connection, the connection I had been yearning for. I knew there was more to this life, I knew there was nothing to fear, that someone or something was looking out for me. My fear of evil dissipated. I got used to feeling my energy leave my body at night, and it became a familiar sensation. Years later I would meet a friend in high school who would explain me that what I was experiencing was astral projection, and I would read books on the subject, as well as on many other metaphysical topics. As a teenager I would meditate and consciously expand my awareness, teaching myself to experience that profound love again and again, I would see auras, and have many other eye-opening spiritual experiences.  Throughout the years I have experienced OBEs in my dreams quite often, where I am flying around outside, in my house, out in space, all over the place. It is a fabulous feeling. I have not been able to consciously leave my body, though-only in dreams. As an adult I am very spiritual but I do not believe in any one religion or doctrine, nor in any god, heaven or hell, or in evil. I believe in my experiences, and in a profound and universal love that we are all a part of, not separate from, because of what I have felt and witnessed in my lifetime over and over again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 20 yrs old, and I was on lithium for 10 years when we come to the present time when this story unfolds, in July of 2013. There are many other events surrounding my experience I am to speak of, which are important to mention. At the time I most likely had lithium toxicity, as I was physically sick and severely confused, and my body was in convulsions for what seemed like weeks. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat very well on my own due to the spasms and it took me an immense amount of time to get dressed and perform normal tasks due to the uncontrollable spasms caused by lithium toxicity. I never knew what day it was it was or what had even happened the day before. I was in bad shape. At the same time I was also malnourished for reasons I can only speculate onmy boyfriend had recently broken up with me so I had fallen into a deep depression, I was hardly eating, forgetting to take my meds, and hardly sleeping. I most likely was suffering from a mental breakdown. I was 89 pounds, which was also caused by the fact that I was on adderall- I had already been underweight, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how in the world I had lost 10 pounds so quickly.

2731,OBE,1238,34,,F,"Thank you very much for creating a space for these stories. I am very excited to tell mine. I am an artist and at the time I was transitioning from sculpture to painting. This extraordinary experience happened about thirty years ago.   One afternoon, before leaving for work, I decided to do a short meditation. I sat down on a carpet in my living room and assumed a meditation position. Moments after I closed my eyes, a clear blue window-like space appeared on the left side of the horizon. My conscious self became molecular, like a blip, or a tigle and I moved at the speed of light through the space. I first saw the edge of a sea. Beautiful sand edged the pristine waters which were gently rolling on to the shore. The area was completely clear of any vegetation or trees. I then found myself in the air, looking down at circular homes which were in a row. They were reminiscent of yurts or hogans. Then quick as a flash, I was inside, looking at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s back. She was tall, dressed in a black robe with crystals around her head. Telepathically I knew that she was a Priestess, a Healer. The Priestess was standing before an altar of some kind. Next, a small room emanating magenta light came into view. The room was translucent; the walls, ceiling, and floor emanated this gorgeous magenta light. Another room stood beside it, emanating a beautiful clear green light. Instantly I understood that these were healing rooms and that this civilization used color for healing and balancing the body.   I found myself outside, watching women and children playing on a hill. It was a bright sunny day and the children were laughing and chatting. On the hilltop there was a white stone post and lintel with three square colors atop the lintel. The colors were tints of the primary colors of red, yellow and blue. Every now and then a boy would run under the post and lintel to stand for a few moments. Then he would zip out to play again. I understood that this structure helped boys balance their chakra energy; it helped their energy flow without hindrance. Only the boys needed it; it was not necessary for the girls to do this.   Lastly, I found myself looking at the back of an old woman who was sitting on a bench. She was contemplating an exterior mosaic or mural that covered a long low wall. I approached this very colorful abstract wall. Soft sounds emanated from it as the colors moved and fused into each other. I knew that my gross ears could not hear the extraordinary beauty of the music that was created by the fusing colors. The wall was alive, changing into different configurations of beauty, much like a kaleidoscope. The old woman had created this beautiful wall and it was she who was responsible for bringing the concept of color healing into this civilization.      I re-entered my body with a great jerk and my eyes opened. I got up from my spot on the floor and went to work in a daze. There is no way for me to put into words how life changing this event has been. Seeing this beautiful world allowed me to understand the power and healing properties of color and sound. I continue to make art that will bring beauty and healing forces into our world.

2737,NDE,1398,32,,F,"I remember a feeling of being sucked out of my body, sort of like separating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with all the stickiness and resistance. After I was completely separated I was observing from above as they were performing CPR and attaining IV access. The doctor put my body in Trudelenburg position. At this point, my attention is drawn away by a feeling that someone was calling me. My attention became focused on this sparkling light, I want to call it a warm glowing light but it is hard to describe because the physical sensation of warmth was not really present. As soon as I acknowledged this light, I was just in it. There were these rainbow orbs that spoke to me and there were people there in what I was communicated to be a sort of holding room. I didnt see anything other than people and orbs in this room that went on for what seemed like an eternity without walls or ceiling. Soon after, I remember laughing but not laughing like in a physical sense, but, in any case, laughing with the people in the room. It was like I ran into old friends and we just picked right back where we left off type of feeling. I dont really have a sense of time of how long I was there but I was guided to another location and there was a woman there who said that I was going to be experiencing what I termed a rewrite. This is so hard to put into words but she communicated to me that a different course was available to me if I so chose to follow it. I felt like everything was more real than anything I had ever experienced, so alive, so intelligent, so revealed. The woman was near a mountain, at the base of it in a vivacious green meadow. We sat for a while but I cannot put into words the things I learned, I dont even remember what I had learned until I come across events in my life that trigger the knowledge that was given to me. I know it sounds strange but it makes sense to me. I was given a choice. You can stay or you can go back. I remember asking questions, like, go back where? And as soon as I asked that question, I knew where. I dont think the complete question even came forth before the answer was already being revealed. This is when I could hear conversations going on. I could hear the people in my ICU room. Complete conversations. I became saddened and wanted to see but I was informed that I had to choose first. I heard my son crying, begging me to open my eyes. My attention went to the woman, her eyes were crystal clear pale blue eyes and she had long dark hair, dressed in a sort of plain creamy colored garb. She never spoke sound words, it was telepathic thoughts. She revealed different life traumas I had experienced up to that point; I was wondering why only the traumas and not the good times, and just as I had that thought the answer was that it serves a purpose and that purpose comes to me at different times since my near death. I also heard my mothers prayers and the prayers of others pleading for my health and wellness. I recall leaving the woman in the field and I just seemed to float away...into space...and it felt as if though I had rushed millions maybe even billions of miles away in seconds. I seen these other worlds and other peoples only to be drawn back in a flash to the holding room. It was time for me to decide and it seemed urgent; will I accept the rewrite or stay where I was; there was no right or wrong choice. Only my choice. I longed for my children, knowing that things would be very different in a bad way if I chose to stay. I was communicated that my road to recovery would be hard at first, but would get easier as time went by. It was hard for me to conceive how this time would be if I returned. I felt drawn back and chose to go back all the while knowing it was going to be difficult. As soon as I made the choice, the people in the holding room became ecstatic and exuberant and I thought this was the strangest occurrence of the whole ordeal. I all of a sudden felt the most unbearable discomfort, my body. I tried to open my eyes and couldnt, I felt the loudness of my heart beating at an unthinkable speed, I immediately came back out of my body and hovered over it for a moment before entering again. The next thing I remember is the nurses and doctor in the ICU room asking me to stay calm because I was connected to a ventilator. My hands were secured to restraints. I couldnt focus my eyes when I first came back, I had been in a coma for 9 days. I had apparently became septic after surgery and went into septic shock. On entering the ICU on July 1, 2002, I slipped into a coma, they intubated me, and there I lay dying until July 9th, my daughters birthday. A few hours had passed and I kept seeing people that the nurses said were not there and experiencing odd things like seeing fish swimming in the air.

I felt totally loved, accepted and strangely connected to this man. Nothing in the whole worlds mattered but him at this moment. I did not stop to ponder his words but was happy.

2740,ADC,1377,51,,M,This is the actual text message I sent Subject: Message from Mum Hi Lone Im just awake and have just finished relaying to Sue a dream I have just finished having about an hour ago. This was unlike ANYTHING I have ever experienced in my life and I guess u may believe what Im about to say or not then thats fine. It was a message from Mum for me and us all. Ill try to describe it but the detail was as good if not better than real life. Ok this is what I was shown and told by Mum mainly. Others I saw were Dad and you. Everyone is happy and come and go busy doing exactly what they want in real life just the same. Same voices same mannerisms and smiling. As you think of some one some place or some thing it materialises and its there for you to touch use and even the smells are the same. The detail blew me away as Mum walked me from room to room by my arm and showed me that her home is still alive and well and shes home living there with all her gear pictures everything. I saw the laundry all full. I gave Mum a big kiss and she was happy to see me and have me visit. Each room was perfect right down to the wood grain on the cupboard doors and wardrobes. It was clearer than I can even remember now. I could touch and feel everything. I said can I look in the huts and I did opening the door and checking both out. The smell was the same lol. They were full of junk And I said to Mum how come and she said we keep all the extra gear in there because us kids arnt there. When I was inside the house if I concentrated real hard I could almost see the burnt walls and floors like a shadow or silhouette but Mum said to me firmly with a serious look on her face that she is NOT going to allow me to see that and it vanished. She said that our home exists in two different places at once. Its like one place is on 92fm and her place is 102fm. They share the same place or space but out of tune so u dont see the other. Anyway we had visitors come and go with cups of tea. Dad arrived in from up the farm smiling and whistling. You arrived for a visit and chat also happy and smiling. Everything coming and going as I thought of them. When I was in Mums old bedroom with the built in mirror I tried to look at myself but when I did I was like a ghost. Very faint and just a shape. And yet I could see the bloody grain in the varnished doors right beside. We went to the A&amp;P show and there were not many people there but it was on. What happens is only the people you knew and think about come through. This explains how in the spirit world its not jammed packed with every person who has passed on just your loved ones and friends coming and going like real life. Ok back home again and Muns really young and beautiful probably in her twenties. See they can appear as any age they want. I knew it was mum. I swung her around then she fell over a chair laughing. I had tea with Mum and now the afternoon was getting darker it was time for me to go. I have her a big hug and began to cry with joy. I knew I was experiencing a dream but it was much too real for just a memory and I could ask questions. I thought I would wake Sue with my crying but I went back to Mum. She smiled and said she is happy and well and not to fear. I asked her if I could come and visit her again but she got serious again and said no but she will think about it. I said how about once a week and I begged her but she smiled and said maybe. Oh well I thought. I walked out the gate and some guys standing on the driveway who looked like Eddie yates. He was wearing a parka and there was a farm implement behind him. I said to him who are you ? and he told me his name. Random spirits appear too and he was out the gate and seemed to be waiting for Dad to come out to see him. I hopped into my car yes u can drive in the afterlife but its cool . You dont have miles of boring nothingness. Next second Im on my way home to Hokitika and I stop in a town. I got out at a park and some guys sitting there in his car with his mouth wide open looking at me. I said what are u looking at ? He says you are bloody flying and floating up in the air. I said so ... You can too come on up so he hops out and flies up to me. He was hopeless and tumbled over. I laughed. Then I awoke in bed at home with tears running down my cheeks and so bloody happy I had to wake Sue and relay this story. It was not a dream but was a real experience. It was like a near death experience without the death. I could see anything I wanted and ask questions at will. I feel a lot more content about home and Mum and I have been shown a glimpse of heaven. It was SOOO nice I can see why Mum is restricting my return. If u stay and dont go back you die and its not my time. But we are allowed to visit but only when our loved ones allow us.

I wasnt paying particular attention to anything and was letting my mind wander when I gradually realized that I was flying, not flying in the airplane, but flying alongside the airplane. It was a wonderful feeling, like the flying dreams that I used to have as a child. The difference was that in my childhood dreams, my body was flying and...and I was asleep. When I was on the airplane, I wasnt sleeping. What happened was that I was listening to the music and then I became aware that I was flying in spirit. That is to say, I saw my body sitting in the airplane but *I* was outside the cabin, in the air just beyond my window. I saw myself there but I wasnt afraid. The whole experience was beautiful. I could feel myself soaring. The freedom and the peace that I felt was amazing. When I first realized what was happening, I just enjoyed it but then,unfortunately, I tried to control it. I wanted to see if I could go up or down and the moment I started thinking, the experience was over and I was back in my body, sitting in the airplane, looking at the clouds outside my window.

2754,ME ,1406,55,,M,"  In 1954 I was born in Astoria Queens, NYC and brought up in the Diocese of Brooklyn. I attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel School and Church. My family moved to Northern New Jersey and I finished my Catholic School in Immaculate Conception in Franklin NJ Diocese of Patterson. To my parents credit one can see where the foundation of my Catholic Faith was formed. I was dragged to church. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there so eventually when I was old enough I left. I lived a very sinful life. One can only imagine where I was but I was not with God. I joined the Navy and began to become an adult and my world did not include God. Things happened to me that in retrospect God must have chose me for better things because my Guardian Angle was very busy.  I met Protestants, while in the Navy. These people were FIRED UP FOR THE LORD. They were obnoxious thumping their Bibles. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them. Finally in 1975 I associated with them enough that in Key West Baptist Church I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. The evil one still had a hold on me and I soon returned to my secular and sinful way of life. As we headed east for Desert Storm in 1990 there were definately more Christians than I have ever seen on an Aircraft Carrier before in my life. History is what it is with that war. Prayer works. Never doubt it.   I did get married to Paula in 1982 in St. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s Church in Sussex NJ. We had a good life as a Navy couple. We attended Mass sometimes mostly non-denominational services. For some reason I developed an attitude toward the Catholic Church.  I retired from the Navy in 1999 and by 2003 we found ourselves in Warrenton VA attending the Warrenton Presbyterian Church. Make no mistake the Pastor and congregation of Warrenton Presbyterian are blessed people. I had attended a Methodist Church for a couple of years, while living in NY so going to church now in my life became a necessary event. But I still was not dedicated to it. I had a Protestant perspective on forgiveness, which is what the Bible says happens if we repent; That is what I was taught by Protestants, however it still is not the teaching of the Catholic Church.  Life was good life was bad. I had some financial difficulties with other obstacles in life and I earnestly prayed to God that he help me get my life in order. Paula and I by the grace of Divine Providence found St. John the Evangelist church in Warrenton VA about 2006. It reminded us of our old time Catholic up bringing and we both felt like re returned home. We stayed.   Now in 2012 at age 57 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to back track. At age 54 or 55 I attended Mass during Easter. Father Cozy discussed the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Saint Faustina. I thought it was interesting that all one had to do was say this chaplet for salvation. Fr. Cozy had planted one of the larger mustard seeds of faith in me, no doubt. As a government contractor my customer was the Navy. I was able to walk the walk and talk the talk with Sailors so I excelled at my job (at least I thought I did). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I was age 55 that I bought my copy of St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary. I had to ride two large deck helicopter and aircraft carriers in a month\xe2\x80\x99s time so my travel to west coast gave me plenty of time to read the diary. I read through St. Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s diary like a novel. I eventually realized this was a 20th Century Saint talking directly to me. She was talking directly to me! Through Providence I started saying one Hail Mary a day also eventually this lead up to a full Rosary. I guess the door with no doorknob on my heart was being opened to Jesus. Things started to happen. While on one of the ships I shared a stateroom with two Harrier Pilots. They were both Catholic and noticed what I was reading. We shared some fellowship. I finished the Diary and it was like there was a bonus CD in the back of the book. The bonus was St. Faustina stayed with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say apparition in this essay, but I will say \xe2\x80\x9cheightened spiritual awareness.\xe2\x80\x9d I had this sense Sister was with me. I attended my first Divine Mercy Service that Easter and completed the novena prior to that. I was able to venerate and kiss a first class relic of St. Faustina during the service a woman had and shared with us all. It was about this time in May that I was coming home form work. I pulled in my driveway and was gathering my wits when in my interior voice. The interior voice! In my interior voice from nowhere I heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice say thank you. The voice was so beautiful and melodic. It could only be associated with Our Blessed Mother. I paused and took it in. Hopefully I said a prayer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember but I probably did.

2776,OBE,1531,30,,F,"I must first start out by explaining that I have had OBEs my entire life, beginning when I was about 9 or 10 years old. It was at this age that I began watching tv programs about people being visited by their guardian angels, or other such spirits, who had saved their lives, or sent these people messages of some monumental significance.  I was very much affected by these programs and began praying to god, or to whoever was listening to me, for some sign of the \xe2\x80\x98other side,\xe2\x80\x99 because I knew deep inside that there was more to life and I wanted to experience it firsthand as these other people did. I prayed every day obsessively and even created my own Ouija board out of paper and a ring, thinking I could make some sort of connection. The ring did eventually move, to my astonishment, but it was just my own energy that I was becoming aware of. So I began to feel my own energy throughout my body, as I do to this day, although for some time I believed it was a spirit taking over my body because it felt so foreign at the time, and as a young child I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better.  Shortly after being aware of my own energy I began to feel my energy leave my body at night when I was falling asleep.  It was incredibly startling and disturbing, as it would jolt me awake, just as I was beginning to fall asleep. As I would awaken my energy would immediately slam back into my body. As a child I thought this was the devil taking my soul away, and I used to cry and pray to god at night. This happened all the time, and it was very frightening, and there was no one I could tell because I knew I would sound crazy. One night when I was crying and praying, I suddenly felt \xe2\x80\x93and had the image of- someone kissing my cheek. I felt the energy touch my face and sink into my skin- and then I felt an immense, overwhelming wave of intense love encompass my entire body, and I knew in my soul that I was loved and taken care of, that I was perfectly safe. I was in complete shock, and my tears turned to tears of joy- someone had responded to my prayers! I knew I was going to be ok! Somehow whatever was happening to me at night was not as horrible as I thought it was\xe2\x80\xa6and so I let it happen, knowing I was protected. I was so stunned by what happened-I had truly made a connection, the connection I had been yearning for. I knew there was more to this life, I knew there was nothing to fear, that someone or something was looking out for me. My fear of evil dissipated. I got used to feeling my energy leave my body at night, and it became a familiar sensation. Years later I would meet a friend in high school who would explain me that what I was experiencing was astral projection, and I would read books on the subject, as well as on many other metaphysical topics. As a teenager I would meditate and consciously expand my awareness, teaching myself to experience that profound love again and again, I would see auras, and have many other eye-opening spiritual experiences.  Throughout the years I have experienced OBEs in my dreams quite often, where I am flying around outside, in my house, out in space, all over the place. It is a fabulous feeling. I have not been able to consciously leave my body, though-only in dreams. As an adult I am very spiritual but I do not believe in any one religion or doctrine, nor in any god, heaven or hell, or in evil. I believe in my experiences, and in a profound and universal love that we are all a part of, not separate from, because of what I have felt and witnessed in my lifetime over and over again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 20 yrs old, and I was on lithium for 10 years when we come to the present time when this story unfolds, in July of 2013. There are many other events surrounding my experience I am to speak of, which are important to mention. At the time I most likely had lithium toxicity, as I was physically sick and severely confused, and my body was in convulsions for what seemed like weeks. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat very well on my own due to the spasms and it took me an immense amount of time to get dressed and perform normal tasks due to the uncontrollable spasms caused by lithium toxicity. I never knew what day it was it was or what had even happened the day before. I was in bad shape. At the same time I was also malnourished for reasons I can only speculate onmy boyfriend had recently broken up with me so I had fallen into a deep depression, I was hardly eating, forgetting to take my meds, and hardly sleeping. I most likely was suffering from a mental breakdown. I was 89 pounds, which was also caused by the fact that I was on adderall- I had already been underweight, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how in the world I had lost 10 pounds so quickly.

2777,ME ,1176,54,,F,"I found myself in a tunnel comprised of dark red glass aperture-like structures which were opening up like a cameras aperture to receive me. I forced myself to look to the left to try to ascertain where I was. In between the aperture blades I could see I was in outer space. I saw a black sky all around with stars. When I turned to move forward again I could see in the distance what appeared to be the end of the tunnel. It was made up of a beige inflatable cushion-type structure. I quickly moved forward to reach the end. I was greeted by an elder angelic-like spirit who began asking me questions almost to verify my identity. I answered them, but after a while, I questioned why I needed to answer all these questions. After that, the being stepped to the right and before me I saw a bright blue sky with perfectly shaped green trees, which had leaves rustling by a gentle breeze, though I could not feel the breeze. Beyond the trees, I saw green lush rolling hills that seemed to go on forever. From my left appeared my deceased father, as he would have been at about 35 years old dressed all in white \xe2\x80\x93 a short-sleeved white tee shirt and white cotton-type pants. He had been 54 when he died. He seemed to communicate telepathically to me but I responded using physical speech. He initially asked me how I was. We turned in the direction of the rolling hills again and this time I saw many people all dressed in white silently walking in the right direction. I did not know these people or where they were going. He suggested we sit at a concrete garden table to the left with 2 concrete benches on either side. Beyond the table I noticed a one-story concrete building with no windows or doors that I could see. My father wanted to know how I was and said he was concerned about me. At the time, I was undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer (DCIS ductal carcinoma in situ, stage 0). I reassured him there was no need for concern as the radiation wasnt bothering me at all and the DCIS was not ever fatal. He told me he was very proud of me. After a time, He asked me to come around the table to where he was sitting so I could give him a hug goodbye. As I did, he asked me to forgive him. The encounter was pleasant up to that point. When he asked me to forgive him, all my memories of how he had been a strict disciplinarian came back to me and I started to feel badly, reliving those feelings I had as a child and teenager. After that, I woke up very quickly.

I walked over to him and he was dressed differently than normal. He had a funny looking sleeveless down jacket on. He was a man who liked to look nice and this jacket was just not him. He had this wonderful smile on his face and his being generated such great warmth. There were no words shared, but I could feel his love beyond measure for me. It was like our spirits were talking.

After taking Ibogaine 18.5 milligrams I began to feel dizzy and went and laid in my bed. Lights were off and all windows were darkened. I was semi sat up in bed with eyes wide open the whole experience. Post two hrs I began seeing light of all colours pour through my ceiling and into my room. I felt at the last point my body being raised and a sense of lightness. About 30 mins after all color had stopped flowing into my room where everything became kinda pixelated. I could see energy like dust particles clearly and then I could see masses of energy which quickly became vivid people in spirit. I could continue to see spirits seven in all and spiders and a big bull frog up until dusk. This the ibogaine wore off and everyone slowly disappeared again.

2785,NDA,1047,35,,M,"She was very weak, had stopped eating and couldnt swallow even an eyedropper of water. She slipped back and forth between consciousness and being non-responsive. the event began casually enough, with her periodically asking Who is that person across the room. Hospice warned me this could happen. Of course I would look and no one was there so I would say I dont know. After a couple more times of mentioning that people were standing across the room, they became closer. At one point, she saw 2 people standing right next to my sister at her bedside. My mom asked my sister Who is that? My sister asked Where? and my mom said Right beside you! Of course that totally creeped out my sister! Keep in mind that although Hospice had given her morphine which I was to deliver as needed, after the first and only time I gave it to my mom, after a few hours she woke up and asked me what I had given her. I told her morphine for the pain. She said They told me Im not supposed to take it so please dont give it to me again. I did not. So the incidents of her seeing people were becoming more frequent and she mentioned a Benjamin which my father said must have been one of her favorite distant relatives that had passed on well before I was born. He said my mother always had a connection with Benjamin in life and that they were good friends. She also saw both her parents and would carry on conversations with them. I would sit by her bedside, holding her hand and she would seem unresponsive yet mumbling as if she was talking to someone. At one point, she was talking to her deceased father, I guess, because my dad and I kept hearing the occasional Daddy come out of her mouth. All of a sudden her eyes would open and she would look directly at me and ask Can you please tell Daddy (or Aline her mother) to come back? I want to talk to them again. One morning, she asked me to go get my father, which I did. She said to him Joe I love you. He said I love you too. She said I dont know whether to LET them help me leave. (We knew she meant her parents and the others she had been talking to). My father asked If you went with them, would you be happy? She said OH YES! Then he said Well, then, you should go. Sometime after that point, they told her what time she would be departing. 1:30. We didnt know whether that meant AM or PM but her demeanor was one of anticipation. She was almost excited. She kept asking (felt like every 5 minutes) What time is it? What time is it now? What about now? Despite our grief, we had to chuckle at her reaction. After that, the next day the chaplin was scheduled to visit at 9:30 am. He called at 9:00 am to say he would be delayed. He told me he would be able to get there at 1;30 pm. the coincidence totally escaped me at that time. I walked into the bedroom and my mom perked up and asked Who was on the phone? (which by the way is really out-of-character for someone who is in a non-responsive state almost 24/7. At that point, she didnt even act as though she knew she was in her own bedroom). I told her it was the chaplin and that he would be there at 1:30 pm. She exclaimed HOW DOES HE KNOW? I had to laugh! I told her He doesnt think you are going to die at 1:30! Hes just late! (little did I know!) So, fast-forward to 1:00 pm. Tracy, the aide was with my mom and I had gone down to my house to bathe and change clothes. A very strong thought popped into my head GET DOWN THERE! I looked at the clock and it was 1:15 pm. My only thought at that point was that I didnt want to miss the chaplin. I ran down the street and met him on the sidewalk as he was leaving. After a brief exchange, I hurried into the bedroom whereby Tracy promptly grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me into the bathroom. Wide-eyed she said I just saw something! Ive never seen anything! I just saw a BIRD fly into your mothers hospital gown! It flew inside the fabric! I saw the gown billow up as it flew across her heart. Then it disappeared! I was speechless. I said come on! and we went back into the room. My mother was having trouble breathing and her lips where turning blue. I looked and Tracy and said this is it, isnt it? Very quickly, my moms skin flashed blue (anoxia?) yellow (jaundice?) then pink/grey again almost like technicolor and at the same time I could hear her lungs filling up with fluid very quickly. No longer able to take a breath, she quickly expired. It was 1:30 pm.

I know I had been thinking about my dad that morning, desperately asking him to let me know if he was ok, like I was doing almost every day. I was standing in front of the mirror getting ready for work when I realized that I could see clearly only directly in front of me, while to both sides reality appeared to be melting into some sort of vertical waves. I had the strong feeling of some sort of presence, but at the same time I was getting increasingly scared that something was seriously wrong with me. The experience must have lasted more than 20 seconds, but this is just a guess. As I turned around to go downstairs to ask for help my vision and the room went back to normal. I now wish I did not get so worried because by doing so I might have stopped the experience. Since then I have tried many times to bring back those moments as I really would like to know what all of that was, but with no success. I have read many STE but I have not found anything similar to what I have experienced. I know that whatever it was it was real and I have not imagined it. If anybody has any idea of the significance of my experience I would be extremely grateful if they could get in contact with me to help me understand what happened that day. Thank you.

I felt very exilerated when I would awaken the next morning. This lasted about 3 days. I felt as if I knew the answers to everything. Time began to slow down and I found children to be absolutely AMAZING! I also saw flickers of light in my periferal vision (often) which I would think to myself were possibly angels. I also had an experience during this time where a light came across my vision (similar to a pulsating and spinning vibration) that took over my complete line of sight (it took about 30 minutes for it to completely happen and it happened while I was at work one day). It also shook me to my core and I realize now that I was frightened by the experience and I quit meditating. It felt strange to be in that state of mind and it did frighten me a bit. Once I was removed from the experience, which was about a month or so. I realized that something incredible had happened to me and that I wanted to get back to it. I have since continued reading and studying metaphysics and have continued with my meditation.

2809,ME ,1302,51,,F,"Sometime in 1996, I was sitting alone in my office in my home in the middle of writing my memoir novel. I was sitting in my chair, thinking at the time. Suddenly I saw a vision in my head that Im entitling Our Human Timeline of Existence. It was a horizontally long image running left to right in my head. There were no words, numbers or sounds, only images. At the left of this horizontal Timeline was the first image. That image was of an ape down on all fours and facing left. To the right of that ape and facing right was a second ape starting to stand up. To the right of that ape and facing right was the third ape, looking Neanderthal. To the right of that ape was a picture of a human being facing right. Then there was a little space. To the right of the space was the image of Leonardo da Vinci\xe2\x80\x99s Vitruvian Man. To the right of that was a very, very long empty area. At the right end of the Timeline, the last image, is a great gust of horizontal wind blurring out the whole right end of the Timeline. That was what I saw. There were no dates on this Timeline. I thought about that vision and why I was seeing it. According to the spacing of the images one to another on the left and then the very long empty space in the middle area and then the wind blur all the way on the right, the vision said to me that, according to where Vitruvian Man was standing in the Timeline, we humans are currently (the 20th Century) into about 20% of our survival, from our beginnings on Earth to our end. I couldnt see our end because that was where the horizontal wind blur was, which took up all the space on the right side. There were no dates, so I dont know how it would happen to us, when, or if it would even happen at all. What I do see is that we humans have many, many more millenniums of survival. I believe I saw this vision and I believe (kinda) in what it was telling me. I wasnt sure what I was supposed to do with this knowledge except to tell people. But since that was one of my first spiritual experiences, I was so new to God (but still an atheist), that I think I told one other person. I wasnt confident in what I saw and I didnt want people to think I was crazy. Im uploading a file of the picture I drew of this vision. I dont remember what day I actually saw it because I wasnt writing down my spiritual experiences yet. So I recorded my vision in this picture at a later time, June 19, 2006.

Terry\xe2\x80\x99s battle with cancer started in 2007-where it was diagnosed in the colon. He was successfully operated on in September that year and recovered, remaining healthy until March 2009, when a tumour was removed from his small intestine. He received chemotherapy at Tygerberg Hospital afterwards and seemed well. He continued to play his gigs-he said the music took his mind away from the pain. His last gig was just after New Year 2012 at the Shuntin\xe2\x80\x99 Shed in Bot River-but he was very weak by then.  The last six months of his life, he was cared for at home-with the help of Hospice. Terry slipped into a coma on Thursday 28th June-I spoke to him and told him it was alright to move on, that his daughters T&#232;gan and Tullia, and I, would be fine. I also asked him to send me a sign when he crossed over. He passed away in the early hours of Friday morning. He was smiling. I knew he had left us, and in the early winter morning, I looked out of the window up at the grey sky-completely overcast except for a very defined sliver of blue sky- in the perfect shape of an electric guitar. I was so grateful for that sign. Terry had asked a good friend of his to sell his beloved Fender Telecaster (which he bought in America) to help support his family-as he had been unable to work for months. I was told that the lady who bought it was called Tracy; and she had bought it for her partner, John, whom we had never met, as they live near Johannesburg. The morning of Terry\xe2\x80\x99s passing; I received a call from Tracy, enquiring how Terry was. I told her that he had passed away in the early hours of that morning. She gave me condolences and put John on the phone. This is what he told me: On the night in question, at about 11:45 p.m. my very faithful dog, Sasha, nudged me with her nose and would not stop...until I got out of bed. I was at my farm, not far from Hartebeespoort Dam at the time. Only to find Sasha sitting next to the Fender case... I made a cup of coffee, called my dog to the kitchen and she would not budge. I know that it sounds weird, but, I had to play the telecaster... my dog left the room as soon as I plugged the guitar into the amp... played a few bars of John Lee Hooker and went to bed. As you know I phoned you the next morning to offer my condolences... how I knew that?... your Terry was with me, of that I am sure...

The guitar is well and safe... I play the smoke out of it and love the mood it leaves me with... I am sure you understand what I mean by that. In any case, I have no opinion on the life here after, but, Terry Dean was with me and wanted to hear me play, to see if I was up to scratch, I think?

2819,DEE,1399,51,,M,"I could hear people speaking who were around me, was well aware of my surroundings--I did not expect this visitation to happen. I had said a little prayer (just in case) asking for forgiveness for those I had directly or indirectly hurt, and waited to die--so I thought. I wondered what it would feel like; i.e., would the lights just go out, would it be painful, or what. I could not tell the sex of my visitor, it appeared to clothed in a lovely robe-like material, was very human in appearance, had a lovely smile, appeared gentle and loving and I could see through it. What surprised me most is that it spoke to me without words. The thoughts just jumped into my mind.

The visitor stayed with me for some time (several minutes) and when I turned to look away, out the cabin window, I could see the lights of a city below. When I turned back, my visitor was gone. In a way, this proved how real the visitation was. It was NO dream. After the plane landed, I was met by an ambulance and taken to Daniel Freeman Hospital. Thinking that I had a Mexican GI upset I was taken to a ward treating GI problems, a nurse noticed that my blood pressure dropped to nearly zero, I was then rushed to a CC unit and placed under the care of a cardiologist, Dr. Ciralo (sp?). There I was diagnosed with severe cardiac dilatation and heart failure, it wasnt until later that a pheochromocytoma was discovered. I was severely hypertensive and apparently this was the cause of my heart failure. When my hypertensive condition was brought under control, my heart returned to normal. This was all documented by ultrasonography and angiography. The pheochromocytoma was removed from my abdomen 1 month later at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.

2822,NDE,1065,42,,M,"From an account I wrote for my family and friends in 2001. The big event happened one night while we were visiting the Oregon Coast. We had not planned to spend the night- but did at the last minute. The only available motel was an older place with horrible soft, old mattresses. From what I can figure out- halfway through the night, while kind of curled up against the wall, I slipped off the mattress, and got wedged between the wall and the mattress. I then had an apnea attack- and the inability to move, or breath, sent me into some state of cardiac failure. This is all conjecture, and only supported by the mild abnormality in my EKG over the past years since. Whether I coded or not, is really not at the heart of the issue or my experience. There are tons of debates regarding what really happens when you die by both medical and theological theorists worldwide. I can only relate what I experienced.  I admit that even as I write, it sounds like science fiction- but I can assure you that it happened- and I believe it to be real in every sense.  Without trying to be overly dramatic, the next events were what I have found to be in subsequent studies, a classic Near Death Experience. I did not see myself in bed (many report floating over their bodies), as the room was too dark- but I was blasted through an amazing tunnel (plasma? lights? not sure) of brightness that brought me ever closer to an unbelievable bright light. In what seemed like minutes (regular time does not seem to apply)- I arrived in a place that was so overwhelmingly bright and swimming with fluid colors of the entire spectrum, that I did not at first realize that I was without my physical body. While I could see- or at least had a sense of the vision that I was seeing- I could not see my hands. It was about this time that my experience was significantly different than others I have read about.  I realized what was happening, and I was not happy about it. Almost immediately, I started screaming, in a voice that I could hear in my head- but could not physically perceive- No f***ing way! (except there are no asterisks in heaven) NO! I am not finished yet! I still have young children- I have not seen my life through yet! NO Damn It! I continued with a stream of verbal abuse of anyone that was listening\xe2\x80\xa6in very profane language, until I heard another voice say, OK\xe2\x80\xa6relax\xe2\x80\xa6its not your time.  I knew at that moment, two very clear truths to be real. First, I was not going to die yet (or stay dead if I was). Second, there was a God and an afterlife beyond our life on earth. Then things got strange, interesting and terrifying.  Unlike other NDE experiences I have read about, I did not see anyone, or feel the presence of Jesus, or Buddha, or Allah. Nor did I see a physical presence of any of my relatives that had passed before me- although I had a feeling that they were there with me.  What I did see was a much brighter place, perhaps 30-50- feet away (I had no real clear understanding of depth or ratio) that seemed almost to pull at my heart (if I had a heart) to come closer. I was awash with a complete feeling of peace, calm and contentment whenever I looked in the direction of this portal. And yet I knew, that moving into the portal would certainly mean that I would not be able to return to my life on earth.  Without speaking, and yet speaking and understanding what was spoken to me, a conversation ensued that changed my life.  You are troubled\xe2\x80\xa6 the voice said. Your need to know the truth about your life, is holding you back from living your life to the fullest.I agreed without speaking.  You must understand the gift to be able to enjoy and treasure the gift that you have been given, the voice said. At this time, while the voice was neither clearly male or female (I realize that does not make a lot of sense), I knew that the communication was coming from all that is\xe2\x80\xa6all that was\xe2\x80\xa6all that ever shall be. The voice was that of what I understood to be God. And yet- even then- while thinking this, it was evident that the entity knew what I was thinking- and chastised me for doubting, or trying to figure out its very existence.  In order to understand that which you feel you must understand to be happy, you must first know what you need to change in your life on earth, the voice said.  In an instant, I was seeing my life in review- first all of the wonderful feelings that had brought joy into my life.

2824,DEE,1305,55,,F,"One day when I was 55, my spiritual life shifted into a new direction. This is a funny and ironic story. I was shopping alone in my local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, buying stuff and yet another set of bed linens because I didnt have that particular shade of beige. I suddenly stopped walking and looked down at all the stuff in my cart and felt a longing. I thought to myself, Is this it? Is this all there is to life? That Peggy Lee song came into my head: Is That All There Is? I just stood there, in that store, staring at all my stuff in the cart, and feeling a strong yearning to find a deeper meaning to life. I wasnt thinking to find God yet. I just wanted to know a deeper meaning to life. I couldnt believe that life was just about cooking dinners, buying bed linens and sending people greeting cards. I didnt realize then that I wanted to find God. The funny and ironic part of this story is that God planted this second seed (the first seed had to do with Rose Kennedys face, which Ill submit soon) at the store called Bed, Bath and BEYOND. A girlfriend brought this irony to my attention, which I didnt get at the time of the STE. At the moment that my STE occurred, I told myself that I was going to find a deeper meaning in life.

2830,ME ,1284,36,,F,"Synchronicity \xe2\x80\x93 This is my calling\xe2\x80\xa6Why the mental health system is antiquated, and why we need to stop pretending we\xe2\x80\x99re robots in a naturally spiritual world. After years of searching for my life purpose it was handed to me on a plate, quite literally from the Universe straight into my head, like a light bulb suddenly being switched on in a deep dark cave of confusion. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t lose me here, you may be thinking: \xe2\x80\x98so who are you and what do you know about re-evaluating the conceptual framework around mental illness or achieving universal peace?\xe2\x80\x99 That is exactly what I thought when the information came to me; I am no Professor or academic guru. That is the point, this has nothing to do with who I am, I have been given this message to prove that anybody of any intellect or social standing can tap into the psychic realm and see a universal truth; all you have to do is ask the question and then believe in the answer.  I have been told by spirit that the mental health system in our Western society desperately needs modifying in terms of spiritual experience. Mental distress is actually a fallacy of modern society which is ever increasing in line with consumerism and will continue to do so unless we acknowledge the problems we are creating. We must see mental distress of any kind with new eyes if human evolution is going to continue in the way it is meant. Mental distress originates in fear, a fear lodged in our past that we carry with us into the present, and project into the future, a destructive fear from which we can be free, individually, and so, universally. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s the irony:My fear of speaking out about this message and how it came to me \xe2\x80\x93 the message that it is fear that stops mankind achieving mental wellbeing, happiness and fundamentally Universal peace \xe2\x80\x93 nearly stopped me from following my path, after years of searching! I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that I\xe2\x80\x99m not still scared, but what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were to tell everyone they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be scared, if I were too afraid to put my head above the parapet and risk being shot at? Before I had my \xe2\x80\x98experience\xe2\x80\x99 I knew nothing about spirituality, and even less about religion. So what happened was as incredulous to me as what you are going to read may sound to you! I have, however, always had good intuition and a kind of underlying \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 since childhood that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching for something that was missing, like I always knew there was another dimension even though society and my education told me otherwise. I was about 12 when I read the book \xe2\x80\x98Utopia\xe2\x80\x99 and to me it was more than just fiction, it was a possibility. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t just think it\xe2\x80\x99s achievable; I know how. It all happened when I had started to meditate at the same time as thinking more deeply about what to be \xe2\x80\x98mentally ill\xe2\x80\x99 actually means. I\xe2\x80\x99d worked within the field for long enough to know about academic theory; the nature / nurture argument and chemical imbalances. What was the truth? I started to question my own sanity, I have always been very sensitive and emotional; where do you draw the line? I am well aware that by writing this, that by voicing my beliefs that I have channelled a message from the spiritual realm, I could be seen by some working within the mental health field as being deluded or having experienced a psychotic episode. You may choose to believe that this is the rambling of an unstable mind, you may suggest that what I am saying is insane. I, however, now know that the real insanity would be for me to ignore such an important message. If I were to ignore it and deny myself my truth for fear of speaking out against a system, I know that I would become mentally distressed \xe2\x80\x93 and that is also proof enough for me to know that the message I have been given is the truth. Many people who try to speak out about their psychic experiences are told that what they are experiencing is not real; that they are \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99. So either way, if somebody has a spiritual experience they are more than likely doomed to some form of mental distress, predominantly not from the experience itself, but from either repressing it due to fear, or from believing they are going \xe2\x80\x98mad\xe2\x80\x99 if they do dare to speak out because they are told that what is happening to them isn\xe2\x80\x99t real.

My husband was standing on the other side of the bed, and I was planning my day in my head about which florist I would buy the flowers from. Out of the blue- and this is very difficult to describe-there was a presence that looked like the jet stream that comes from a squid.

I understood that each light represented one person and the color denoted their state of happiness or unhappiness. He then tilted this map up so I could see it from the side, revealing that it was actually TWO maps that appeared as one when seen from above...one layer of spiritual beings on top interacting with the people down on Earth!

2838,NDA,1047,35,,M,"She was very weak, had stopped eating and couldnt swallow even an eyedropper of water. She slipped back and forth between consciousness and being non-responsive. the event began casually enough, with her periodically asking Who is that person across the room. Hospice warned me this could happen. Of course I would look and no one was there so I would say I dont know. After a couple more times of mentioning that people were standing across the room, they became closer. At one point, she saw 2 people standing right next to my sister at her bedside. My mom asked my sister Who is that? My sister asked Where? and my mom said Right beside you! Of course that totally creeped out my sister! Keep in mind that although Hospice had given her morphine which I was to deliver as needed, after the first and only time I gave it to my mom, after a few hours she woke up and asked me what I had given her. I told her morphine for the pain. She said They told me Im not supposed to take it so please dont give it to me again. I did not. So the incidents of her seeing people were becoming more frequent and she mentioned a Benjamin which my father said must have been one of her favorite distant relatives that had passed on well before I was born. He said my mother always had a connection with Benjamin in life and that they were good friends. She also saw both her parents and would carry on conversations with them. I would sit by her bedside, holding her hand and she would seem unresponsive yet mumbling as if she was talking to someone. At one point, she was talking to her deceased father, I guess, because my dad and I kept hearing the occasional Daddy come out of her mouth. All of a sudden her eyes would open and she would look directly at me and ask Can you please tell Daddy (or Aline her mother) to come back? I want to talk to them again. One morning, she asked me to go get my father, which I did. She said to him Joe I love you. He said I love you too. She said I dont know whether to LET them help me leave. (We knew she meant her parents and the others she had been talking to). My father asked If you went with them, would you be happy? She said OH YES! Then he said Well, then, you should go. Sometime after that point, they told her what time she would be departing. 1:30. We didnt know whether that meant AM or PM but her demeanor was one of anticipation. She was almost excited. She kept asking (felt like every 5 minutes) What time is it? What time is it now? What about now? Despite our grief, we had to chuckle at her reaction. After that, the next day the chaplin was scheduled to visit at 9:30 am. He called at 9:00 am to say he would be delayed. He told me he would be able to get there at 1;30 pm. the coincidence totally escaped me at that time. I walked into the bedroom and my mom perked up and asked Who was on the phone? (which by the way is really out-of-character for someone who is in a non-responsive state almost 24/7. At that point, she didnt even act as though she knew she was in her own bedroom). I told her it was the chaplin and that he would be there at 1:30 pm. She exclaimed HOW DOES HE KNOW? I had to laugh! I told her He doesnt think you are going to die at 1:30! Hes just late! (little did I know!) So, fast-forward to 1:00 pm. Tracy, the aide was with my mom and I had gone down to my house to bathe and change clothes. A very strong thought popped into my head GET DOWN THERE! I looked at the clock and it was 1:15 pm. My only thought at that point was that I didnt want to miss the chaplin. I ran down the street and met him on the sidewalk as he was leaving. After a brief exchange, I hurried into the bedroom whereby Tracy promptly grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me into the bathroom. Wide-eyed she said I just saw something! Ive never seen anything! I just saw a BIRD fly into your mothers hospital gown! It flew inside the fabric! I saw the gown billow up as it flew across her heart. Then it disappeared! I was speechless. I said come on! and we went back into the room. My mother was having trouble breathing and her lips where turning blue. I looked and Tracy and said this is it, isnt it? Very quickly, my moms skin flashed blue (anoxia?) yellow (jaundice?) then pink/grey again almost like technicolor and at the same time I could hear her lungs filling up with fluid very quickly.

The light moved through my hand that was resting on my husbands stomach/chest and entered into my husband. I was awestruck and began to weep tears of (joy) for a lack of term. I did not tell my husband what I had experienced. The next day we had a scheduled appointment with a marriage counselor. The counselor started as always with Gene how do you feel. His answer confirmed what I had saw the night before. Gene ALWAYS would answer with fine or good. This time is answer was I feel more spiritual. My jaw dropped and I then explained to the counselor and my husband what had happened the night before.    ,,U.S. Citi,"25,000",religious,religious,Christian,Christian,,,weekly,week,very strong,very st,"100,000+",colle,Teacher,,marri,marri,No,very strong    Q,All pleasant,adult

It was so holy and so far beyond my human conception that I felt I was going to die because it was just to holy to bare. I instantly understood that I was a child of God, completely loved and accepted. No longer was God some idea up in heaven, but was part of me. I also felt as though God had always been with me and it was I who was not searching. I was now completely free as though released from a prison and now my life is beginning.

I was still shivering and all I could think about was being warm again. I was in a warming-type tube that was pumping hot air to warm me up. I have no idea of the time or how long I was drifting in and out of sleep. As I was lying there freezing &amp; shivering, I clearly remember that while my eyes were closed the light came on in the room. Instantly I was warm. I remember thinking, oh wow, I am finally warm. I was so relaxed and relieved to not be shivering. I was literally lying there basking in this warm light feeling so wonderful! At some point my logical side asked the question of who turned on the light? When I opened my eyes the entire room was filled with a brilliant light. What I remember very well was that this light although very bright, did not hurt my eyes. The light was beautiful, peaceful, pure. It is difficult to have the proper adjectives to describe this light. At some point I began looking around the room. Sitting at the foot of my bed was the figure of a man. I could not see his face as the light appeared to be radiating from behind Him. I knew without a doubt that this man was someone very important and spiritual. I felt no fear and had complete understanding at the time that I was in the presence of someone from heaven. Without speaking the way we do here on earth, He spoke to me. He said 4 very clear sentences to me. 1. You are going to be alright. 2. I have work for you to do. (I then asked, What kind of work? I will do anything.) 3. In My own time. 4. Now rest my child. It seemed that within a few seconds after the final message, the light went away and I immediately began shivering again and was cold.  I glanced over at my sleeping husband and said, did you see him? He looked at me as if I were crazy. I remember thinking that I had dreamt this but it was so very real, so physical and so peaceful. I was unable to really talk about this experience for a very long time. When I was able to share it, it was very, very emotional for me. I felt unworthy of this visit. Why me?

I understood that each light represented one person and the color denoted their state of happiness or unhappiness.

I was consumed with the beauty of this. He then told me I had to go back, that I needed to stop being so shy and start opening myself up to people. I couldnt go back until I completed this.

2860,DEE,1272,64,,F,"Hank and I vacationed every June at a resort in Lenox, Massachusetts. It was a week-long event that offered workshops to the many people who returned year after year.  For four years I gave a workshop called Conversations About God. This open forum invited people to talk about how they felt about God and about their spiritual experiences. It was not about religion, only God. We talked about the signs we received from God and about miracles we saw or heard in our personal lives. My goal for this workshop was for us to get close to God and to connect with each other. On Friday, June 26, 2009 at 1:45pm, I went to a room to conduct my workshop which was to start at 2:00. I was standing by the rooms door waiting to greet people as they arrived. A man walked up to me. He was a large man, about 62. He had white hair nicely styled...bald on top, longish on the bottom. He wore a geometric-designed tent garment that covered him from neck to knee. His face was clean-shaven with pink shiny cheeks. He had this powerful and pleasant look on his face. But I was struck by his face because it was glowing. There was an unmistakable glow coming from his face, as if a light was on inside his head. I could see that the glow was of a spiritual nature. I couldnt stop staring at his face and its glow. I asked this man if he was a minister. I was wondering if he was coming to my workshop for personal or professional reasons. He was friendly and said that he wasnt a minister but that he came for personal reasons. We chatted lightly while waiting for the rest of the people. Normally about 20-25 people came to my workshop but it was 2:00 and no one else showed up. We went inside and I set up chairs in a circle. One other man came. He was a regular participant who lived in Boston. We were friendly and teased each other because he was a Red Sox fan and I was a Yankees fan. By 2:10 I could see no one else was coming. I thought it was strange. Not even my husband Hank came that day and he came to all my other workshops. This man and I immediately locked into each other, talking. I dont really remember all that we talked about. That part of the conversation was blocked from my mind. The Boston man tried to talk with us but we totally ignored him, though not with malice, so he got up and left. The man and I continued our conversation. Then this stranger said to me, Youre an E.T. Master. I looked at him for a long while. I took him seriously, thats the strange part. Whats an E.T.? I was scared to ask this question because I kind of knew what ET meant and I was afraid to hear him say those words. He paused, staring at me, You know, an extraterrestrial. My spirit and my eyes were locked with his spirit and his eyes. Oh, I think I said. Im an Angel, he matter-of-factly said to me. I believed him. I believed everything he was telling me. I wasnt afraid of him and I didnt think he was crazy. I trusted and totally believed this total stranger. Thats whats so strange. I didnt even want to come up here, he said. I have work to do and a wife and children back home in Texas. I wasnt even planning to come to your workshop. I was sleeping but a loud noise woke me up so I looked on the agenda to see what workshops were scheduled. I saw your workshop and decided to come. Now I know I was sent here to see you. Whats your name? I asked. You can call me Fred. What work do you do? Im a CPA. What am I supposed to do? What are you saying to me? I dont understand. Are there books I should read? He looked away from me and said: You will be meeting people. They will show you the way. I dont remember what else we talked about in the one to two hours we talked. But I do remember that I was spiritually locked into him, like I was spiritually locked into the glow and cross and the ghost. He got up to leave and said goodbye. I said goodbye but I didnt get up. I couldnt get up. I was just sitting there, numb-like, just staring ahead. He stopped and turned around, Are you okay? Yes, Im okay, was all I could say. I sat alone in the room not really thinking about anything. Then I returned to Hank, told him a little bit about my unusual workshop but I didnt tell him then what Fred said to me. Later that night I saw Fred one more time at a dance our event put on. As soon as I saw him I went over to give him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and I said thank you. He smiled. He didnt say anything, though. We parted and I went back to Hank and we danced the night away. I remember looking for Fred in the dance room but I never saw him again. I regret not knowing his last name or not asking for his contact information. I tried to find out more about him so I could contact him but the organizers of the event couldnt help me without a last name.

The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away.

I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away.

No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light. A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body.

It is BLACK! no stars, no planets, no lights, NOTHING! Void. A black hole I dont know what else to call it. Except in a very, very, very far distance is a very small gold and I mean GOLD light flickering like a candle or generator running off cycle or something. I began to get closer and closer. The GOLD light grew larger and larger and closer and closer. As I got close enough I could tell what looked like a snow globe or very lucent clear crystal ball and this GOLD light was inside this globe. As I got closer I could tell inside this globe were what looked like stars. Sort of looking into the sky from earth. But inside this globe these stars were very bright or a crystal or bright white. It is nothing I have ever seen before or can compare to it. There were no bright and dim stars, they were all the same. In this middle was this Golf glowing light. I did not go inside this and was kept at a distance hanging out in this blackness. On the way all I could feel is a state of AWE! no words, just a beyond any middle boggling experience anyone could have imagined. On this travel it was like your mind is wondering out there and focused on this GOLD light thinking what is going on?. Getting closer to this globe I noticed I began getting messages or bits of information or something that seem to be sending these messages to me. These messages begin telling me some things I need to work on. Which I did not understand at all. I am beginning to get a better understanding each day since.

Normally about 20-25 people came to my workshop but it was 2:00 and no one else showed up. We went inside and I set up chairs in a circle. One other man came. He was a regular participant who lived in Boston. We were friendly and teased each other because he was a Red Sox fan and I was a Yankees fan. By 2:10 I could see no one else was coming. I thought it was strange. Not even my husband Hank came that day and he came to all my other workshops. This man and I immediately locked into each other, talking. I dont really remember all that we talked about. That part of the conversation was blocked from my mind. The Boston man tried to talk with us but we totally ignored him, though not with malice, so he got up and left. The man and I continued our conversation. Then this stranger said to me, Youre an E.T. Master. I looked at him for a long while. I took him seriously, thats the strange part. Whats an E.T.? I was scared to ask this question because I kind of knew what ET meant and I was afraid to hear him say those words. He paused, staring at me, You know, an extraterrestrial. My spirit and my eyes were locked with his spirit and his eyes. Oh, I think I said. Im an Angel, he matter-of-factly said to me. I believed him. I believed everything he was telling me. I wasnt afraid of him and I didnt think he was crazy. I trusted and totally believed this total stranger. Thats whats so strange. I didnt even want to come up here, he said. I have work to do and a wife and children back home in Texas. I wasnt even planning to come to your workshop. I was sleeping but a loud noise woke me up so I looked on the agenda to see what workshops were scheduled. I saw your workshop and decided to come. Now I know I was sent here to see you. Whats your name? I asked. You can call me Fred. What work do you do? Im a CPA. What am I supposed to do? What are you saying to me? I dont understand. Are there books I should read? He looked away from me and said: You will be meeting people. They will show you the way. I dont remember what else we talked about in the one to two hours we talked. But I do remember that I was spiritually locked into him, like I was spiritually locked into the glow and cross and the ghost. He got up to leave and said goodbye. I said goodbye but I didnt get up. I couldnt get up. I was just sitting there, numb-like, just staring ahead. He stopped and turned around, Are you okay? Yes, Im okay, was all I could say. I sat alone in the room not really thinking about anything. Then I returned to Hank, told him a little bit about my unusual workshop but I didnt tell him then what Fred said to me. Later that night I saw Fred one more time at a dance our event put on. As soon as I saw him I went over to give him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and I said thank you. He smiled. He didnt say anything, though. We parted and I went back to Hank and we danced the night away. I remember looking for Fred in the dance room but I never saw him again. I regret not knowing his last name or not asking for his contact information.

In this darkness I felt every cell of my body bathed in peace and love and comfort. No pain, not a euphoria, but just simply wonderful. It felt so good.

I looked up at the ceiling in our bedroom asking God for a sign. I asked him as a Catholic, saying out loud: I have faith and I know they say he is in a better place, but I need MORE! I need PROOF that he is OKAY! And just as I shouted this at God a sudden loud bang and flash of white light filled the bedroom. Shawn and I physically jumped out of bed because the crash was so loud we thought the window was going to crash in on us. We looked at each other, puzzled. Was that for us? Because the timing was just as if God was answering my prayer. Just as that happened we began to calm down and the rain also subsided. I told Shawn that it felt like an answer from God and it was so strange. The next morning Shawn went out to our car that was parked on the street. He heard muffled music playing that grew louder as he got nearer. When he opened the car door the radio was blasting music very loud on my brothers favourite radio station. When Shawn tried to shut the radio off, it would not turn off, he had to pull the system out of its dock to make it turn off. The radio remained like that for years. The wires were fried because that night our building and our car was hit by lightening, the very lightening that crashed outside our window at the very moment I asked God for a sign / for proof that John was okay. That isnt the end of it. From then on it was like the floodgates had opened. I got all kinds of signs from John, all kinds of instances of after-death communication, including a full apparition, physical phenomenon, electronic phenomenon and I would like to share that all here. I could write my own book about all the signs John gave me and my family after his death. He loved us so much his love transcended death and the tragedy of his loss made it that much more important that he get through to us and let us know he was okay.

2887,NDE,1117,30,,M,"I was walking along a road. It was not paved, but a gravel path, very nicely maintained with beautiful flowers along the sides. The road started in a valley and went up a hill towards a very beautiful mansion or palace with a gate in front of it. It was far off in the distance from where I began to walk, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say how far exactly. On either side of the road, the land sloped away sharply, like going off a cliff, so if one fell off the road, one would land in a deep, dark pit. From the pit one could hear sounds of agony, wailing, and lamenting from human beings who were down there. Some tried to claw their way up and grab at me on the road, but I knew they could not actually reach me. I was a little afraid at first, as I knew this to be the pit of hell. The road was not narrow, however, so there was no danger of me falling off the road. I began walking towards the gate, all the while the lost souls wailing until I got near to the gate. Close to the gate, they were no longer around. The mansion was very beautiful. The whole environment was other-worldly, somehow glittering and radiant. I knew I was on another plane, no longer on Earth. I could hear the gentle music of stringed instruments in the background, very soothing and lovely. Eventually I started nearing the gate of the mansion or palace. The mansion was actually quite far from the gate, but one could see radiant beings behind the gate going about their daily activities. Some were carrying baskets with flowers and all were going about their daily routine. There was complete unity and love there, unlike the way people on Earth behave. It was serene and peaceful, just a wonderful place, and I really wanted so much to go inside. There were four winged angels guarding the gate on the outside, two on each side, and as I approached, they moved together and crossed their arms, blocking my entry. They were radiant beings, clearly not human. They were so very kind, but were not going to let me in, although they did not say anything to that effect. There was so much joy and peace there, I tried to get by them, when a group of beings from inside approached the gate to talk to me. An elderly \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d (not a human being) with white hair spoke to me. Although he was right in front of me, his voice sounded like he was very, very far away. It was almost like I was hearing an echo of something said in the distance. He said I would be there at a point in time, but not yet, that my mission was incomplete and that I still had a lot more to accomplish. He was very kind and spoke gently to me, absolutely convincing me that I could not get in. Until this moment, I had really not thought about anything relating to my earthly life, although I knew who I was. I was dressed as I was the day of the accident. When he told me that I could not enter, only then did I start to try to think about what had really happened to me and what was going on. I thought it odd that I was the only person around and there were no dogs or other animals. As I was considering all this, I left that place. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I actually regained consciousness at that precise moment, but I suspect I did. I did not recognize any people whom I knew previously who had died.

It was daytime and I was preparing some food when my eye caught an object by the floor. I looked down and saw a little white square paper wedged up against the dark green backsplash runner by the floor. I picked up the paper. It was actually an empty little envelope with a gold lining inside. The envelope looked like it was opened after it was sealed because it had a rip in the flap. It was the kind of gift envelope that contained a card with someones name on it that youd give with a gift at Christmas. On the front of the envelope was the hand-printed word Dad. It looked like my handwriting but I didnt remember giving my father this envelope in the 2 1/2 years we were communicating just before his passing, and we didnt talk to each other for 29 years previously. In my home, a random and obscure object just doesnt turn up mysteriously in a strange place like that. I stood there with a shocked feeling, staring at the envelope. I thought I knew it came from a spiritual source but I wasnt ready to accept that. I had to rule out all possibilities. I called for Hank to come down and showed him the envelope. I asked if it was his. He said no. I asked if he ever saw this before. No. Could he imagine where it came from? No. I asked if it fell out of the newspapers he recycles in the kitchen. He said no. I told him where I found it and that it came from Holy Spirit. Hank became agitated and got a little angry. He was annoyed that mysterious, spiritual things like this were happening to me and darted back upstairs to his office. I stood there looking at the envelope and asked out loud: Dad, are you here with me now? Suddenly, a brisk wind came across my bare shins and I felt the chills. Then I knew my father was with me. I wanted to know more about this mystery, so I called a cousin of Hanks who was a Deacon at a Catholic Church in New Orleans. I asked Gary what all this meant. He said that God made my father my Guardian Angel and that my father would be watching over me. This was awesome.

That means, I noticed in a conversation with my friends, we where sitting at a table, and we were debating on something, which actually did not make sense, but in that moment I have seen the spirit part of my friends saying lets go, and in that instant my friends got up and left. Than there was a situation I wanted to trade my car. So I went to the cardealer and talked to him, there was no reason that I would not have been able to trade in my car. I had money and good credit. But I heard the spirituell conversation again, and there was a headshaking no on my side and the cardealer said ok, I am not able to trade in your car. I wanted to by a cheap place, and there it was again, the no from both places. Everything I my ego wanted to do, I felt like I move against a wall. Everything I my ego thought would be good for me, moved through my fingers. I was actually out of control, even though I knew what I was doing. It did maked absolutely no sense to me than, now I do. I would share many many things. But I think I would have to talk or write to you more about it.

2899,ADC,1019,26,,F,"My experience was not a moment in time event, but rather its like I became aware of my grandpa through intense emotions and became aware that he was trying to tell me something. It takes a few days of this flood of emotion before I realize something is wrong and he is trying to tell me. The best way I can describe my most resent experience is like a gnawing feeling at your core that something is wrong, and at the same time an intense feeling of my grandpa. Not him in the sense of physically being next to me, but this feeling of the love we shared, the grief I felt when I lost him, and replaying the experiences we had together. The thoughts of him flood my mind and almost become distracting. My mind would constantly wander back to thoughts of my grandpa and just intense deep feelings. (The first few times this happened to me was when my two of my grandpas brother died, my uncles father in law was dying and my aunt was diagnosed with cancer it wasnt until afterward that I pieced together my intense feelings surrounding my grandpa and the news). After I became aware of my grandpas presence its like I knew something was wrong, and he was trying to tell me or make me aware of something bad. Knowing something was going to happen was unsettling and my mind would race at the possible events that might happen. Then when my phone rang and it was news my uncle had had a massive stroke, it was instant that this what he was telling me. Knowing that my grandpa is here with me is something I can not describe in words...its a feeling you get deep in your gut that you know everything is going to be alright.

The ball of light said something to me. As much as I want to, I dont remember what, but it was something very short and simple.

2902,OBE,1238,34,,F,"Thank you very much for creating a space for these stories. I am very excited to tell mine. I am an artist and at the time I was transitioning from sculpture to painting. This extraordinary experience happened about thirty years ago.   One afternoon, before leaving for work, I decided to do a short meditation. I sat down on a carpet in my living room and assumed a meditation position. Moments after I closed my eyes, a clear blue window-like space appeared on the left side of the horizon. My conscious self became molecular, like a blip, or a tigle and I moved at the speed of light through the space. I first saw the edge of a sea. Beautiful sand edged the pristine waters which were gently rolling on to the shore. The area was completely clear of any vegetation or trees. I then found myself in the air, looking down at circular homes which were in a row. They were reminiscent of yurts or hogans. Then quick as a flash, I was inside, looking at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s back. She was tall, dressed in a black robe with crystals around her head. Telepathically I knew that she was a Priestess, a Healer. The Priestess was standing before an altar of some kind. Next, a small room emanating magenta light came into view. The room was translucent; the walls, ceiling, and floor emanated this gorgeous magenta light. Another room stood beside it, emanating a beautiful clear green light. Instantly I understood that these were healing rooms and that this civilization used color for healing and balancing the body.   I found myself outside, watching women and children playing on a hill. It was a bright sunny day and the children were laughing and chatting. On the hilltop there was a white stone post and lintel with three square colors atop the lintel. The colors were tints of the primary colors of red, yellow and blue. Every now and then a boy would run under the post and lintel to stand for a few moments. Then he would zip out to play again. I understood that this structure helped boys balance their chakra energy; it helped their energy flow without hindrance. Only the boys needed it; it was not necessary for the girls to do this.   Lastly, I found myself looking at the back of an old woman who was sitting on a bench. She was contemplating an exterior mosaic or mural that covered a long low wall. I approached this very colorful abstract wall. Soft sounds emanated from it as the colors moved and fused into each other. I knew that my gross ears could not hear the extraordinary beauty of the music that was created by the fusing colors. The wall was alive, changing into different configurations of beauty, much like a kaleidoscope. The old woman had created this beautiful wall and it was she who was responsible for bringing the concept of color healing into this civilization.      I re-entered my body with a great jerk and my eyes opened. I got up from my spot on the floor and went to work in a daze. There is no way for me to put into words how life changing this event has been. Seeing this beautiful world allowed me to understand the power and healing properties of color and sound. I continue to make art that will bring beauty and healing forces into our world.

2905,DEE,1297,67,,F,"Hank, my husband, and I were getting ready to move on December 10, 2012 from Ossining, New York to Milford, Connecticut. Most of the house was already packed up. I had gone through the whole coat closet downstairs by the front door, throwing stuff out and organizing what I wanted to pack up at that time or wait until moving day. There was a small shelf above the coat hangar bar that I looked over while standing on a stool to see what was up there and what needed to be thrown out. There were mostly gloves and hats which I kept there in case we needed them. We had just arrived home at night from eating out Thanksgiving Dinner on November 22, 2012. Hank hung up his coat first in the lit up coat closet. Then I took out a hangar, hung my coat on it and, while looking toward Hank and talking to him, I went to hang up my coat without looking at the bar or what I was doing because I knew that closet so well, after living in this house for 22 years. I had trouble getting the hangar hook to go over the bar. I tried and tried but the hook wouldnt go on the bar. It kept getting stuck on something. So I looked at the bar and saw there was a chain of some kind hanging down from the shelf above. There was a sliver of an opening between the slats of the wooden shelf and a chain had made its way through the opening and hung down in a loop, the narrow opening of which happened to be facing the tip of the hangar. So when I aimed, without looking, the tip of the hangar to go on the bar, it went through the narrow loop instead and got stuck there. I looked at the chain. I couldnt understand where this chain came from. I knew everything that was on the shelf and there was no chain. I pulled on the chain. It came down through the slat opening and a medallion of some kind followed it. I looked at this medallion with its long neck chain in the palm of my hand and just stared at it. I couldnt believe my eyes. That was my medallion and my chain that I had mysteriously lost 5 years previous. I had this piece of jewelry custom made for me, based on the image that I had seen when I was 29 years of age of a glow and cross. The medallion was a white Mother of Pearl flat, round disk (glow) with a MOP cross affixed onto the disk. When I received this gift to myself from the jeweler, I loved it and wore it every single day for about a year. One night Hank and I were going to a special place and I wanted to wear a special necklace that would conflict with the medallion and chain, so I took it off and probably placed it on my dresser in the bedroom, as I was planning to wear it again the next day. I either placed it on the top of my dresser or put it into my jewelry drawer in the dresser. The next day when I awoke, I looked for the medallion to put it on again and I couldnt find it. I looked on the dresser top, in all the drawers, on the floor around the dresser, in our bedroom, in the bathrooms and in all the rooms of my home, but Hank and I couldnt find it. It was missing for about 5 years and during those years, I kept on looking all over my house for the medallion, but with no luck. Then I thought that God was mad at me for taking it off, so It took it away. So, 5 years later, God had miraculously given back to me my medallion in such an incredible way. I showed it to Hank in disbelief. He was amazed how that medallion came back to me, and 5 years later! Then I told Hank that I had a bad thought, that It gave it back to me because something bad or hard was going to happen during or after our move and I would need this medallion that I loved so much and which connected me to God and Its serenity. Ive been wearing the medallion every day since and will wear it every single day always, even if it doesnt go with a fancy outfit. Our move was hard but Hank and I survived it and are doing well. Although we have to move again in a year and dont know where we will live, though we want to stay in Milford.

2907,SDE,1308,41,,F,"After I fell to the ground and my father was with me we chatted like normal, then all of a sudden he said we have to go and see my step-mother and brother. The whole time I experienced this the beautiful warmth and light was upon me, to describe the light as best I can, is like having a massive spotlight place over you and the rim of the light is pure white and protective, inside the light is the perfect warmth, like the temperature is set to perfection. As we walked over to my step-mother I said to her please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know this, I then placed my hand just under her left shoulder and just above her breast and said Dad wants you to know he loves you with all his heart and soul the look on my step-mothers face was shock and tears welled in her eyes. We then walked over to my Brother (who had a 20 yr feud with my sister) I said to him again, please dont be afraid I have Dad with me and he wants you to know, with that I then placed my hand over his stomach, and said Dad understands the feud between he and my sister is deep seated within them and could they please let the past be and find a way to love each other again, my brother was also shocked....I told him again, not to be afraid. After I gave these messages to my family, we walked over to a rose garden, the whole time the light was with me and the most beautiful, euphoric feeling I can not describe was with me. In between the messages I kept repeating to Dad how beautiful it was. When we sat at the rose garden, Dad asked me if there was anything they could do (we werent allowed to tell him during the week he was dying) I said there wasnt the cancer had spread to most of his body and I just kept also repeating Look Dad, look how beautiful it is I was just in awe of it. With that he was gone and I was back to reality. I returned to the motel we were staying at, thinking that the experience was spurred on by lack of sleep or stress. I thought I was losing my mind. Later that day I returned to the Hospital and was in the kitchen when a nurse came in and I told her that I thought I had lost my mind and was it normal when a loved one was dying, I told her about what I had experienced and thinking she would agree that it was stress induced, the nurse (Paula) then stated that is exactly what Dad would experience when he does finally pass. I was shocked. We both returned to Dads room only to find he was awake and outside in the courtyard, with two other nurses beside him. We couldnt believe it. He was telling my brother, as best he could as for most of the week it was hard to make sense out of much he was saying to us, he told my brother he had enough and then looked straight at me and said I have had enough Im ready to go because its beautiful isnt it buttons (a nickname Dad callled me) I was shocked but replied with a smile and said It certainly is Dad. The most wonderful calm came across me and I knew then everything would be alright. Paula (the nurse) then placed her hand on my shoulder and said, There is your confirmation. Later the next day, we all couldnt believe it when my brother and sister were standing in Dads room, hugging each other and genuinely sharing a laugh together. I then softly whispered in Dads ear, See Dad, you did it, I heard you and they are getting along now, everything is ok and you can go now. I know he heard me as I felt a weak grip on my hand as I was holding his hand. A few days later I found out that the messages I had given to my step-mother and brother were almost identical to what my Dad was trying to say the morning I had the experience with my father. I wasnt in the room at the time.

2917,ME ,1478,46,,M,"This life changing event happened to me the latter part of October 2004  For many years I\xe2\x80\x99d been searching for a closer walk with God and financial success. My library of books and tapes are very extensive. I have read many books over twice and listened to tapes and CD\xe2\x80\x99s over and over and over again. I\xe2\x80\x99d started this learning process about 5 years ago and for the last three years I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten very serious about it. So much so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t read the paper, I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch the news on TV and my TV time is limited to almost nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve rented about 5 movies in the last five years. No movie theaters and I\xe2\x80\x99d recently turned off the car radio of any type of media or learning material and just thought positive thoughts while driving. The books that I read are the Bible, books on how our minds work, books on Personal Development and Spirituality. However I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe that the Spirit world existed So one day I have no Idea how I got there but I\xe2\x80\x99m on the website of a well known Success coach and trainer. On her site an interesting book catches my eye. I order the book and it arrives quickly. I start reading the book and it makes allot of sense. About a third way through the book I come upon a passage that says \xe2\x80\x9cOk, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to now tell you about my 5 agreements in business not to be confused with the Four Agreements of Don Miguel Ruiz. If you want to learn about his four agreements you can get his book titled the Four Agreements and read about them\xe2\x80\x9d.  Nothing else was mentioned about that subject and I kept reading. About 3 pages after that statement I felt compelled to go back. I found the author and the title of the book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Four Agreements\xe2\x80\x9d. I was sitting at my desk in front of my computer so I went to Ebay and clicked on a Buy It Now and had the book in my hand three day\xe2\x80\x99s later. I thought it came to me very quickly. The book is written I am told, at a sixth grade level and it has about 140 pages. So I ate it up and read it in about 3 days. After reading it I thought to myself. This book makes so much sense. Just 4 agreements and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to memorize a bunch of affirmations and make sure that I find the right one to say for the situation in my stack of 3X5\xe2\x80\x99 cards. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking this is one of the best books I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and it\xe2\x80\x99s so simple to understand and implement. So I go in for round two with this book. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read it again. About half way through the book is when it happens. My vision: It\xe2\x80\x99s 10:00am and I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting at my home office desk reading the book for the second time. The morning light is shining through my French doors. I\xe2\x80\x99m about half way through it when the room goes dark. I turn my chair to the left toward the light switch to see who\xe2\x80\x99s there. I stand and I drop the book to the floor out of my left hand. My desk is to my right. The book lands on a wood floor, bounces a couple of times and makes an echo like a book bouncing on a wood floor in an empty room. (The floor in my office is carpeted) I look around my room and it\xe2\x80\x99s not my room anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s now as large as a high school gym and empty of everything except for my desk and chair and the floor is wood. My Room looks like an empty school gym. It is then that I see my office door. It\xe2\x80\x99s glowing and the colors on it have changed from white to Lapis Blue and the handle on the door is glowing an Orange/Gold color. The door appears to be breathing in and out. On it\xe2\x80\x99s in breath the door is puffed up and show cracks with the orange/gold color in them. The door and handle are illuminated like they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to explode and catch fire. I see smoke coming in from the door jam around the door frame on its out breath.

When I was on the airplane, I wasnt sleeping. What happened was that I was listening to the music and then I became aware that I was flying in spirit. That is to say, I saw my body sitting in the airplane but *I* was outside the cabin, in the air just beyond my window. I saw myself there but I wasnt afraid. The whole experience was beautiful. I could feel myself soaring. The freedom and the peace that I felt was amazing. When I first realized what was happening, I just enjoyed it but then,unfortunately, I tried to control it.

2938,NDE,1052,42,,F,"As I was holding my son I began praying (to a God that I hoped existed although I certainly was not sure actually did...too much scientist in me). As I held him and prayed I became keenly aware of this dark presence following quickly behind my son and me. This awareness was not in real time but still, an intense awareness of this strong force. I began having chills and intestinal disturbances and felt true terror. As I felt this force nearing both of us and about to encircle us. I was very aware that this force was actually the dark angel of death. My prayer changed from please God, allow my son to live to God, if you have to take him then he is your child not mine. And I am aware that I am your child as well and you will have to help me. At that precise moment I felt a shift in my sons breathing. In the upper left corner of the room I became aware of a brilliant and luminescent light. This light slowly grew and filled the upper quadrant of the darkened room. I honestly thought that I was having a stress induced migraine and was having an aura. However, when I turned my head the aura did not follow with my movements. The light remained in that left upper corner of the room. The brightness of it grew and grew and enlarged to where it filled the room. I tried to look at the light but it was too bright. The light was the most brilliant and beautiful light that I have even seen. I had never (and still have never) seen anything like it. It was more than light...like it had consistancy. And then this incredible awareness occurred and my thought was oh my God, its God. And in that moment I becamse aware that God was/is more real than anything else that I had ever seen or known. My perception of God changed in that instance from my being a skeptic to the assurance that God is a definite and known entity. It was as real as anything that I have ever seen. I felt bathed in this glow and felt warmed....held and loved. Im not sure how long this lasted but slowly the light rescended but the awareness did not. The feeling that I had was the peace that surpasses all understanding. I knew that my son was going to be fine. My chills disappeared and I felt no more worry or anxiety. The doctors continued to check on my son and finally an hour after the light appeared they came in and said we think that hes turned the corner. I felt like they sure got the news on a delayed schedule. For a long time I felt that I was having some stress response to my sons health crisis but the knowing has never receded.

2945,DEE,1297,67,,F,"Hank, my husband, and I were getting ready to move on December 10, 2012 from Ossining, New York to Milford, Connecticut. Most of the house was already packed up. I had gone through the whole coat closet downstairs by the front door, throwing stuff out and organizing what I wanted to pack up at that time or wait until moving day. There was a small shelf above the coat hangar bar that I looked over while standing on a stool to see what was up there and what needed to be thrown out. There were mostly gloves and hats which I kept there in case we needed them. We had just arrived home at night from eating out Thanksgiving Dinner on November 22, 2012. Hank hung up his coat first in the lit up coat closet. Then I took out a hangar, hung my coat on it and, while looking toward Hank and talking to him, I went to hang up my coat without looking at the bar or what I was doing because I knew that closet so well, after living in this house for 22 years. I had trouble getting the hangar hook to go over the bar. I tried and tried but the hook wouldnt go on the bar. It kept getting stuck on something. So I looked at the bar and saw there was a chain of some kind hanging down from the shelf above. There was a sliver of an opening between the slats of the wooden shelf and a chain had made its way through the opening and hung down in a loop, the narrow opening of which happened to be facing the tip of the hangar. So when I aimed, without looking, the tip of the hangar to go on the bar, it went through the narrow loop instead and got stuck there. I looked at the chain. I couldnt understand where this chain came from. I knew everything that was on the shelf and there was no chain. I pulled on the chain. It came down through the slat opening and a medallion of some kind followed it. I looked at this medallion with its long neck chain in the palm of my hand and just stared at it. I couldnt believe my eyes. That was my medallion and my chain that I had mysteriously lost 5 years previous. I had this piece of jewelry custom made for me, based on the image that I had seen when I was 29 years of age of a glow and cross. The medallion was a white Mother of Pearl flat, round disk (glow) with a MOP cross affixed onto the disk. When I received this gift to myself from the jeweler, I loved it and wore it every single day for about a year. One night Hank and I were going to a special place and I wanted to wear a special necklace that would conflict with the medallion and chain, so I took it off and probably placed it on my dresser in the bedroom, as I was planning to wear it again the next day. I either placed it on the top of my dresser or put it into my jewelry drawer in the dresser. The next day when I awoke, I looked for the medallion to put it on again and I couldnt find it. I looked on the dresser top, in all the drawers, on the floor around the dresser, in our bedroom, in the bathrooms and in all the rooms of my home, but Hank and I couldnt find it. It was missing for about 5 years and during those years, I kept on looking all over my house for the medallion, but with no luck. Then I thought that God was mad at me for taking it off, so It took it away. So, 5 years later, God had miraculously given back to me my medallion in such an incredible way. I showed it to Hank in disbelief. He was amazed how that medallion came back to me, and 5 years later!

2950,NDE,1138,34,,F,"As I pondered my situation, I slowly became aware of overwhelming feelings of peace, love, acceptance, and certain knowledge of perfection and purpose. I felt great awe. It quickly became clear to me that the light was the ultimate intellect, love, and creative force. The psychological environment in which I now existed literally permeated around and through me. I knew that Light knew my every nuance, every thought, and every deed. Amazingly, it still loved me, even viewed me with a certain sense of delighted humor. In an odd way the Light was part of me. Yet it was also everything else. As I easily, and happily, settled into this new environment I realized that time and space were very different than what I was used to. I could follow multiple trains of thought and experience in what seemed to be a simultaneous manner. It was akin to how we use time in dreams in that numerous situations were playing out in \xe2\x80\x98no time\xe2\x80\x99. I was luxuriating in the perfection of the situation, while simultaneously making mental notes of my surroundings. At the same time, Light was addressing me thru telepathy and instilling within me what I later called scrolls of knowledge. These scrolls unraveled and revealed information about the true nature of reality. I think that the figurative scrolls were thought forms that existed within Light and Light was mentally pushing them onto my consciousness. I had no idea what they meant, as the ideas and knowledge contained within was light years more complex than I could grasp. I sensed the periphery and intent of the scrolls and knew that it would take eternity to sort it all out. Still, the bit I could sort out made it clear that in the physical dimension we are capable of experience far beyond what we ever imagined. Prior to the NDE I had experienced three enormously frightening out-of-bodies. Frightening because I \xe2\x80\x98caught myself\xe2\x80\x99 in the upper corner of the ceiling, watching myself sleep on each occasion. I did not know what was happening. I had never heard of an out-of-body experience. Now I knew, clearly, that the out-of-bodies were normal, and just the tip of the iceberg of what humans could and should experience. I received, thru telepathically transmitted images and thoughts, a glimpse of the fully developed multi-dimensional being. As I floated within Light, numerous paths of information were being delivered to me. I felt peaceful, and perfect. Suddenly I heard a deep male voice say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go back?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBack?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cback to where?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to go back, concentrate on that noise\xe2\x80\x9d, it said. My thought was NO; I do not want to go anywhere! The thought of leaving this new, yet strangely familiar, environment seemed a travesty. Still for some reason I turned my attention slightly to the left. Far away, as if thru a long train tunnel, I heard a faint noise. As I listened more intently, it got louder. I realized it was my beloved husband Ed. He was screaming my name. The next thing I knew, I was coming to consciousness in my bed. After returning to physicality I felt very lethargic and drifted off to sleep. The NDE remained clear in my mind. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it was, having never heard of an NDE, but I knew it was real. The next day Ed phoned me at work and said he had scheduled an appointment with my doctor, and was coming over to take me to it. At the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office he said I had been having some sort of seizure that did not involve convulsions. It was more like a dead person. He said my body had seized up like it was frozen and my eyes had rolled back in my head. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me until now, as he did not want to scare me. I thought I had just lost consciousness.

2965,ME ,1067,33,,F,"I prayed for probably 3 4 months, as I continued to read the Course and do the workbook. Suddenly, literally out of the blue, one day I had an encounter with my boss where I felt blamed for something that wasnt my fault. He said something to me, and I responded in a really defensive way. The moment I spoke my response to him, I felt the left side of my scalp tingle. Not just a tiny tingle, but the ENTIRE left side of my scalp really tingled like the way you might imagine it feels when a cats hair stands on end. During this encounter with my boss, I was fully aware something strange had happened on my scalp...but I was too wrapped up in the defensive discussion to really pay that much attention to it. Later on the same day, I had a negative thought about something else, and this very strong tingle thing happened again. Very shortly, I realized what seemed to be happening was that my prayer had been answered...I was being shown without question, which of my thoughts had a negative component to them by having this very strong tingle each and every time I had one! This amazed me, and still does to this day. For the next several months, I got used to this feeling and played around with it. It happens without fail, when I have any thought that violates Gods (or our own) nature. If my thought is really big, the tingle is really big and covers the entire left side of my head. If my thought is smaller, a passing thing, the tingle will still be there...only reduced to a tiny tingle on mostly the top of the left side of my head. As I worked with this feeling, I learned very quickly how to avoid the types of thoughts that would make the tingle happen. At this time, I rarely have the tingle...ie: I have trained my thought process to be much more loving. The tingle is still there very strongly if I slip up, however. I can also make the tingle happen on purpose, simply by deliberately thinking about a very negative or hateful emotion. I thought this was interesting in that it is something I can do at will, as well as it being there to warn me off bad thoughts when I havent been trying.

I didnt realize then that I wanted to find God.

2969,ME ,1287,57,,F,"On January 12, 2002 something pivotal happened that enabled me to open my mind to believe in God. My husband Hank and I were staying at a historic, antique-filled bed and breakfast, Butternut Farm, in Glastonbury, Connecticut. (I dont think the owners of this establishment would want it to be made public that their bed and breakfast is haunted.) It was Saturday night and we went to sleep on the comfortable and luxurious bed. In the middle of the night, I woke up, eyes wide open, and sat up tall in bed. Looking back on this experience, I must have looked like I was in one of those movies when someone is under a spell and rises from their sleep with their eyes wide open, back straight as a board. I didnt hear or smell anything and I wasnt touched by anything but I instantly turned my head to the left and saw something. About three feet away from me, suspended in mid air about eye level to me, was a ghost. The ghost was shaped like a huge, round, horizontal Bayer aspirin tablet. It was flat on the top and bottom with rounded edges. It was about two feet in diameter. The ghost was made up of thousands of tiny black particles, each shaped like a sperm, which furiously rotated clockwise as fast as a tornado. It spun around so violently that it spewed off some of the tiny black particles. But, although the ghost was just a couple of feet away and although it was spinning as fast as a tornado, I didnt feel a breeze and none of the particles touched me. It was as if the ghost was contained in its own little world, separate from my human world. This whole experience actually lasted just a few seconds, because as soon as I sat up and turned my head and my eyes saw the ghost, as if it saw me looking at it, it instantly broke down into an amoebic mob of black particles and made a mad dash for the closed old door and disappeared through the long crack of the warped frame. I sat up for a while thinking about this experience. Strangely, I did not feel fear because if I did, I would have awakened my husband. I did feel a sort of fear because I didnt want to put my head back down on the pillow, afraid to go back to sleep, afraid the ghost would return. But I was very tired and layed back down to ponder what I should do. The next thing I knew, it was morning. As soon as we woke up, I told Hank about the ghost. He just listened to me. He looked like he was believing me. I told him there probably was a small chance it was all a dream but I didnt think so. It didnt feel like a dream. It felt real and I remembered it in vivid detail. When we went downstairs for breakfast, I was so excited that I told everyone in the dining room what happened to me that night. The two owners mockingly pooh-poohed my story but there was a visiting pastor from Pennsylvania. She also stayed overnight because she was to give a sermon at a nearby church. She confirmed that she was also visited by the ghost. She said she didnt see what I saw but she woke up during the night and felt its presence sitting in a chair by her bed. She said that in her line of work, people often came to her with stories and issues concerning ghosts and spirits. With the pastor as witness, I was validated 100% that I did indeed see a ghost. Actually, I think this pastor was an Angel because in the days ahead I tried to reach her but I couldnt find her anywhere, even though she gave me her business card. It was as if she disappeared. Seeing the ghost was a shocking but crucial experience. It had served a greater purpose in my life than just to amaze me. It took about a year for me to digest and process the ghost before I could tell anyone else. Then I told a friend. After getting this experience out, I started to really think about the ghost. It suddenly dawned on me that I saw a ghost! The reality of seeing a ghost, I realized, became proof that there really was a spiritual world. Standing now on the threshold of this whole new world, my mind looked out and wondered: Wow! Now that I know there really is a spiritual world and that ghosts are real, what else can I believe in? The answer came in my very next breath: God. But, still, I didnt find God for another year. And on that day, everything became crystal clear.

2976,NDE,1098,37,,F," I started drifting off and could only vaguely hear them now.  I found myself floating down a long tunnel. I looked all around and was aware of a soft and mesmerizing light at the end. I wanted to rush towards it but found it hard to move forward and could do so only by forcing myself forward half swimming, half walking. Then, I heard a distant faint voice cry out \xe2\x80\x9cSinus rhythm collapsing, we are losing her\xe2\x80\x9d but I felt completely disinterested in this. Who was being lost? I did not know who they were talking about and was annoyed at the interruption. Now I only had eyes for the wonderful glowing light at the end of the tunnel which seemed to hold promise of great warmth and love unending. I felt so joyful and excited and all awareness of my body on the bed left me as I tried for some time to reach the light. I knew absolutely that wonderful things were awaiting, if I could only get to the end of the tunnel. The light now loomed larger and I could see faint outlines of figures waiting there, beckoning me forwards. I wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is waiting there, is it Sai Baba, angels or loved ones?\xe2\x80\x9d I tried harder and harder to reach the end of the tunnel.  Then, a very faint voice interrupted my travels with a tiny urgent \xe2\x80\x9cBaby on Board\xe2\x80\x9d and a pleading \xe2\x80\x9cBreathe! You must breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. (A nurse was apparently shouting loudly into my ear). This caught my attention. I stopped in the middle of the tunnel and wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho has a baby on board, who should be breathing?\xe2\x80\x9d And then thought \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is me, perhaps I am pregnant, if I am, then I must go back\xe2\x80\x9d and I turned reluctantly around. It was so hard to leave that wonderful promise of all-encompassing Love and Joy waiting in the Light and those light filled beings waiting there. The return down the tunnel was brutally sudden. I came back to consciousness to experience total chaos, doctors were shouting and my whole body was in pain. I felt icy cold, but I could see I was indeed pregnant. My memories flooded back and I knew I had many children and others who needed me to hold on. I fought to come back and although the heart rhythm was still unstable, immediately went into labour. Serious faced heart specialists told me \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t have the baby yet, we will deliver in two weeks when your heart has settled down\xe2\x80\x9d. I did not argue, I could see their point, but I knew from my previous eight deliveries that this labour was not a trial run. So exhausted, I steeled myself for a long night. Whether it was the right time or not, this baby was on its way. I was informed later that day, that I had flat lined for some time and that had this episode happened at our house, some one hours drive from the nearest hospital, both William and I would have died. I reflected on that urgent message in the morning, no wonder I had to get to hospital that day. How strange the many delays that had led to the nurse colliding with the heart specialist! I realized that I had been somehow protected all the way through this crisis. I also felt enormous gratitude for the nurse who had shouted in my ear, because I realized that I had only turned back because of her prompting as all knowledge of my present life had been wiped out. At dawn the following morning with labour well advanced, a grim faced team of Heart specialists and surgeons gathered to deliver the baby. I was hooked to a bank of heart monitors, and had needles in my feet, arms and hands. The recalcitrant heart was still racing and wobbling around. Their ominous expressions told me that they didnt give much for our chances under anaesthetic.   Would you like to leave any messages? I was asked. None, I replied. My husband and children knew I loved them, I told them that every day. Since seeing the two little boys standing together on that planet four years earlier in the OOBE, I felt sure that William at least, would survive to be with his brother. As the anesthetic took hold, I felt totally at peace, after all I had come close to the Light and it was so wonderful, I had no fear of death left. William was delivered with only minor difficulties apparently unharmed by his pre-natal adventure in the Star Trek ship!

I also had an experience during this time where a light came across my vision (similar to a pulsating and spinning vibration) that took over my complete line of sight (it took about 30 minutes for it to completely happen and it happened while I was at work one day). It also shook me to my core and I realize now that I was frightened by the experience and I quit meditating. It felt strange to be in that state of mind and it did frighten me a bit. Once I was removed from the experience, which was about a month or so. I realized that something incredible had happened to me and that I wanted to get back to it.

2987,DEE,1234,24,,M,"Introduction While I read through \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven\xe2\x80\x9d I was struck by the similarity of several distinct items that were present within a spiritual experience that occurred to me. The items that Dr. Eben Alexander presented in \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Heaven that were similar if not identical to what I experienced are as follows: 1.) Peoples clothes were natural to the environment. 2.) The experiences were perceived to be magnitudes more real than normal life. 3.) The \xe2\x80\x9cglorious chant\xe2\x80\x9d was everywhere and came from many places. 4.) A exhilarating sense of unity with all that exists. 5.) Dr. Eben Alexanders description of communication as, \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts that entered me directly\xe2\x80\x9d is similar to the direct communication with the Word of God that came upon me. The Word communicated as if through every subatomic particle field--not through words but through the Word of God. Although the religious experience written here is in dream format, the information transferred and situations experienced were of a supra consciousness nature. The religious experience developed as an independent psychological process over a twenty year period--from adolescence to adulthood. The religious experience happened to me at age 24 on September 03, 1979. I am 57 years old. Since I was 24 years old I have had no extraordinary psychological experiences. Personal experiences with direct spiritual development of consciousness are eternal and transcend both living experiences and after death experiences. Heaven is not strictly an after death state and something, perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic mind,\xe2\x80\x9d interacts with the human brain and shares some obscure affinity with each human mind. In a sense \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d is omnipresent; heaven is all around us but we typically fail to see it. Both living and after death experiences attest to this fact. This experience is of the living variety.  The Trances From age 4 through 21 I had experienced approximately 10 trances that would take me to what seemed like another dimension. My first recollection, of two symbols that appeared in one form or another throughout the trances and in the religious experience, was from a time as a kid with high fever. I saw two sparkling nuns that were walking along an infinite seashore. Children were playing beneath a sun umbrella and fragile autumn leaves blew across the sand. I perceived an infinitely dense black line coming from the sky to crush the leaves, the sun umbrella and the children. I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe line. the line\xe2\x80\x9d as my mother put cold water and rubbing alcohol on my forehead to reduce the fever. The trances stopped occurring during fever (associated with illness) around 10 years old. But I would try to stay awake by watching T.V. late into the night because I knew the trance would take place if I fell asleep and that scared me. Usually when the trance started Id get up out of bed and sit in a chair. The experience then caused the world to fade out. The walls of the room would disappear and a dark space with two huge dense masses of sparkling energy would transfer their energy back and forth through a sparkling, connecting line along which the energy flowed. I had no recognition of my presence. When the one mass would become infinitesimal to the point of disappearing, the other would become dense and heavy. Then I would become frightened. But, eventually, the energy would transfer out of the dense and heavy sparkling mass along the line and back into the one that almost disappeared. The last few times, around 20 years old, when I experienced the trances, the episodes were witnessed without fear. Id get up out of bed, sit on a couch and simply watch the show. Afterwords, I thought that was really strange but it didnt make any sense so I didnt think much of it. When I was 24 years old, at a time when my mind was biologically mature, I had a profound religious experience that seemed to be the end result of the trances. It was in the form of a dream that I could understand. Although this experience was in dream-like symbolism. I experienced it far greater than waking life experiences. Perception and emotion while in it had been enhanced. I often referred to an increase of reality to a magnitude of 10 when recounting the experience. Carl Jung stated that what acts is actual and this experience was actually the most intense experience in my life. Like a dream that you try to recall, while it fades away with the more time that passes between waking and the writing of it, much of the details escaped my memory at the time of writing it. I was in tears and quite overwhelmed upon waking but some parts of the dream that I remember and wrote are still remembered along with the emotional intensity as evidenced in my consistent effort",,US Citize,2001 2,spiritual,spiritual,Unaffilia,Christian,,,dail,week,very strong,avera,"0 24,999",some,Machini,,single,single,Unc,very strong    Q,Pleasant & distressing,adult

Following a series of God-sent visions, I entered a Bible study program in the Catholic Church that led me to Eucharistic Adoration. During my first Eucharistic adoration, the love of God, emanating from the Eucharist, surged like a wave through my being. I was immediately released from remorse.  A few months later, an acquaintance who works for the Catholic Church asked me to create a self-published prayer book of remembrance for parents who are grieving the death of a child from miscarriage or abortion.

I went into the bathroom in this spirit form and saw a great statue perched on the closed toilet seat that looked like a statue but I didnt realize it was the angel of death but either way I didnt feel any fear from it. I saw some mini creatures that were about 2-3 feet in size going into the drain of the bathtub happily and willingly and as the approached the drain they would spin as if being flushed and I could see this great release on their faces and wanted to experience that same release too. So I decided to follow them and the moment I willingly resigned my soul for it to be permitted to be flushed down the bathtub drain I felt for the first time complete separation of myself from something that had always been with me but because I had never been without it I didnt know I had always had it...that was this connection to God. It was only in that vortex that I immediately knew I had made a mistake by stepping into that bathtub drain and called out to God and asked him to take me back to my body on the couch over and over but the tunnel vortex thing I was in spinning inside of and going deeper felt so isolated and I felt so alone and felt that my pleading and cries couldnt even be heard from God. Then the angel I had seen perched on top of the toilet next to the bathtub swooped down and caught me as I was decending in the vortex and I began to justify myself to God asking why would you permit the angel of death to personally escort me to Hell I am not a bad person?

3032,DEE,1111,32,,F,"Sometime during the night, I began to dream. (Highly unusual because I NEVER remember dreams although I am sure that I do dream). I was present in this dream. I knew immediately that something unusual was happening. I was wearing a long white robe and I had sandals on my feet. It was very warm. I remember thinking wow why is it so warm in a dream this is way too real. Just then I bit down and felt a grain of sand between teeth. I stopped and said to myself wait, this is important because it is real. I walked between 2 buildings made of what looked like adobe to me and I kept walking until I entered a courtyard that was of good size. There were clusters of men standing around talking with one another and they were dressed somewhat like me except they had more colorful gear on. I remember thinking that I was in Bibical days by the way they looked. In the center of the yard were a group of boys playing some kind of ball. They were chasing a ball (that was really a bunch of rags tied together). They were kicking the ball back and forth and seemed intent on playing a game. As I looked around, over to my right was a young boy about 8 to 10 years old. He had that look of dejection about him. He was leaning against the wall with his left shoulder. He was looking down and was moving the sand around with his foot. My mother instinct kicked in and I felt compassion for the boy because I knew he had not been chosen to play. I moved over behind him and that is when I reached out and touched his shoulder. He turned and looked straight into my eyes. The air literally left me and I dropped to my knees. You see, it didnt matter that he was a boy I knew him. I knew him and I began to cry. It was the Savior. Without his lips moving, transferring language to me directly to my head (but more putting it into English falls so short; it was like a thought that came to me and then blew up inside my head) but I HEARD his voice and I knew it. How do I know it? I dont know but in that moment I remember saying Oh, I know that voice! I knew that I missed him so much. I knew that I had been bought and paid for (atonement)if I chose to allow it (free agency and all). I loved him. I sensed the largness of the universe and how there was no end . . . but wait . . . he spoke Cindy, I never fit in. From that statement I understood that he didnt have to show me the cross . . . he really means he was a weird human among humans. That is all that I heard . . . everything else is as real . . . it just was that odd hearing/listening thing. Here is the significant exchange to me . . . I felt the love. It is more than love, but on Earth that is what we say. I knew it was for EVERY single human who was going to live and who had ever lived. If was like I could have reached out and picked it up . . . it had substance. And, it hurt. The love was so much that it hurt and I was humbled by what I felt. It was over. I sat straight up in my bed and looked at the clock. It was 2 a.m. For the next few weeks, the feeling didnt leave me. Sometimes I would just look at a group of students on the BSU campus and want to burst into tears because I knew how much he loved them. Then, like all things, the memory started to fade. A few months later, I got down on my knees and begged for the gift of always remembering that feeling and the event. I dont think about it every day. I am 61 now. But, I can recall it all.

3035,DEE,1251,40,,F,"My experience happened approximately 2 weeks after Sept 11, 2001. I had been meditating in bed and felt myself drift off. My now ex-husband was sleeping next to me. Suddenly there was a bright light surrounding me. I could not see anything but gold light. The brightness of the light began to dim so I could open my eyes. When I did, there was a beautiful Michael Angelo angel with me. It was very large, probably a good 7 feet with huge wings and a face that was so serene. It was the most beautiful face Ive seen. And filled with such kindness. I felt like I was in a huge warm wave because the vibration surrounding me was like being rocked by a gentle tide while lying in a boat. It was beyond comforting. The angle knew that I was very upset about the direction of humanity after 911 and told me, not with spoken words, but with telepathic words, that everything would be ok and that I needed to keep reminding people what brought us to that point. I needed to speak of bring love and not focus on hate or enemies. The angel told me it knew I felt very alone but to remember that I was not and that I should keep putting out the message of love. It touched my face and then it slowly vanished. I was sitting up in my bed and tears were streaming down my face and I cant even describe how I felt because there are no words...but I was the most comforted I had ever been in my life and felt like I belonged to God and the universe.

I saw her arms moving very quickly, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what she was doing. There was blood all over my abdomen. Another doctor was threading something into my chest, he was at my left side.

I was \xe2\x80\x9cKrista\xe2\x80\x9d but not attached to the body below or the events going on in the room. I was simply an observer. I wanted to keep watching but was pulled to my left by a very strong force. I resisted only for an instant, then knew I must go. It was almost as if I was \xe2\x80\x9csucked\xe2\x80\x9d into this tunnel-like space. There were no defining \xe2\x80\x9cwalls\xe2\x80\x9d, only a static-like grey/white/black type of atmosphere throughout. I was a part of this static. I was moving at lightening speed.

There were beings lined up to my left, waiting for me to arrive. I did not know any of these beings.

3054,DEE,1300,23,,M,"My fathers office was divided into two spaces--a 2nd floor front office where he worked (with large windows overlooking the street below and surrounded by several multi-story apartment buildings), and the back office--a large bright kitchen/lounge area (illuminated by skylights)--connected to the front via a private 20 foot corridor. As soon as I arrived and handed my father the story, I felt that same strange feeling in my heart like I had felt a year earlier--the feeling that compelled me to pray. Not wishing a repeat of what happened a year earlier (see my other DEE entry)--I excused myself, telling my father I would wait in the back lounge while he read. My father wasnt spiritual or religious, and I was embarrassed that I suddenly felt a strange urge to pray. I entered the back lounge, and shut the door. I then got down on my knees and bowed y head to the floor for the first time in my life. And I suddenly started to weep. Like, uncontrollably sob. And words came out of my mouth that werent words from conscious intention. I was baffled to hear myself speaking the words. Why are we so bad? Why are we so bad? You have to understand,I didnt have a bad bone in my body. I was kind, and sensitive, and yet, these words were flowing from my mouth. And I felt such deep deep shame. Moments later, however, I felt a hand press down on the small of my back. I tried to left my head up to see who was there, but like my hands suck together in the previous DEE, this time my whole body was stuck to the floor. Quite literally, I was pinned there and couldnt move. Before I had a chance to be afraid, however, I suddenly felt two firm hands grasp my head, lift it off the floor, and turn it to the right. And there, beside me, was a fully manifested Celestial Being, kneeling on the floor beside me and looking compassionately into my eyes. As I previously wrote, my family wasnt religious, and I had no knowledge of religion at all. However, I immediately knew this Celestial Being was Jesus like I had known him my whole life. He was bearded, and wearing simple robes. (I no longer remember the color of the robes or the color of his eyes--I was too astonished that he was there in the room with me.) His eyes were mesmerizing--I was literally transfixed by his gaze. Where I had been sobbing moments earlier, and feeling deep shame, I suddenly felt the most incredible all-encompassing feeling of unconditional love. I wasnt scared. I was in bliss. And there wasnt anything I needed to ask. I felt as if I knew everything, as if I was everything, as if I was the Love itself. And a message was transmitted to me with this Love. You are loved. You are forgiven. You are respected. You are accepted. You are special and you are important. You are cared for, and everything is perfect. All of this transpired in a matter of seconds, and then Jesus bowed his head to the floor and prayed. And the hands that had moved my head to see Jesus, turned my head back to the floor, and continued to hold me there. The next thing I remember, my father opened the door and asked me if I was okay. No, I said. Im pinned to the floor. Please call Mom. While my father went back to the front office (there was no phone in the lounge), my experience suddenly changed dramatically. I was suddenly hearing sounds that were loud and clear and very real, but very distressing. The sounds were of emergency sirens, gunfire, and women shrieking in terror. At the same time, in my minds eye, I could see the major urban intersection near my fathers office with windows all blown out, burned out shells of cars in the street, and snipers scurrying in the shadows. I thought I was being shown a vision of the end of the world, but when I asked if that is what this was, there were no answers. Moments later, my father returned, and I found that I was able to get up off the floor. My mother was on the phone and wanted to speak with me, so I headed to the front office. However, as soon as I walked into the office and saw the large picture windows, I was immediately stricken with the most intense paranoia. I collapsed to the floor, certain that I was going to get shot by a sniper (probably connected to the frightening vision I had moments earlier). Long story not as long, this paranoia lasted another half hour or so during which time my father managed to get me into his car and drive me to his house (my old family house where the previously reported DEE took place). Once I got home, and was under the care of my mother, the paranoia dissipated. However, it transformed into a mania that lasted for another 40 hours or so, during which time I believed I knew everything about everything, wrote many things about God and life, and couldnt sleep. Finally, after about 40 hours, I crashed and slept for 16 hours.

3057,ADC,1402,29,,F,"At the time, I described it as the most real and vivid dream I have ever had. In the dream, my deceased grandfather was communicating with me. He had passed away approximately ten years earlier and I had always said that I couldnt believe how much I missed him, even so many years after his death. This was my first loss and I took his death very hard because he had always been my father figure- my birth father had never been around (and died when I was 5), AND my relationship with my adoptive father was not close at all. Some specific details of the dream were not clear such as where we were or in what capacity my grandfather came to me, but I do remember that in the dream, I was very aware that it was impossible (in my understanding) for him to be there, communicating with me. My response in the dream was basically, How can this be, you are dead? I dont believe he said much to me, but I was so excited to have this time with him and I remember wanting to introduce him to my life since his death. I had no kids when he died and I wasnt married although I was dating my now husband. So, in the dream, I was feverishly trying to catch him up on all the events of my life...getting married, having two beautiful kids, going to university to become a teacher. I wanted him to be proud of me and I wanted so desperately to keep him around and involved in my life.  When I woke up, I truly felt that I had really lived this dream...a feeling I had never had with a dream and I remember wanting to cry because it was so real and vivid and now that I was awake, I couldnt get it back.  This has never happened again, and I always wondered if it was more than a dream.

3058,ME ,1314,33,,M,"I awake to nothing. No body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space: no near, no far, no light or dark. No heat, no cold. No emotion: no joy, no fear. Just calm awareness in a gray void.  A moment / eternity passes. Light! A brilliant sun! And with it, darkness: the fullness of empty space. A small human figure stands in silhouette. My consciousness shifts. I become the figure; a human body standing in space before a radiant globe. I feel! I am bathed in intense light and heat; light and heat so intense that if I were in a physical form I would be vaporized. I am engulfed by boundless, infinite energy; overwhelming energy. Another shift in perception: energy becomes love. Energy and love are the same. Energy is love. I am embraced and cradled: infolded by a boundless field of energy/love, love which is personal yet vast beyond comprehension. I am seen; seen through. The barriers and masks that we construct to present an idealized persona to the world are blown away. Though the experience is veiled to me I perceive that my life in its naked reality is being lived and fully comprehended by a conscious presence. There is no judgment. My being with all its shortcomings, failures, and rough edges is unconditionally accepted, loved, and cherished.  I become aware that what had first appeared like a sun is un-like anything from ordinary reality. I am in the presence of a radiant, fluid luminosity. An amalgam of water and light is the best approximation I can think of. The sense of being before a conscious presence intensifies.  My mind buzzes with the desire to hold It, to explain and contain It with my thought. The more I grasp, however, the more It slips away. It cannot be grasped or named. I give up, let go, and allow myself to simply rest with It. With this shift from desire/grasping to acceptance I am permeated by light. In a blaze, the dark husk of my body flakes away. I become light. I am one with the light. I am the light, a fluid, radiant luminosity. I have no body. No senses: no sight, no hearing, no touch, no taste, no smell, no thought. No perception of time or space. I am calm awareness in a radiantly luminous field of joyfully dancing light.  A moment / eternity passes. I find myself with a luminous body. A thought is expressed without words: approach your live with joy and gratitude; compassion and acceptance. A cosmic chuckle: clear-eyed and hard-nosed. I am laughed at/with. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take your self so seriously\xe2\x80\x9d rings in my mind. As I turn from the light a frigorific presence rushes from behind and past my left ear. It is a transparent nothingness consuming all energy in its path. It radiates a cold animus and an implacable will to be separate; to differentiate. As it rushes past an iron darkness warps around me. It fuses to me and I become dark and solid. I awake to an ordinary day.

3062,PLR,1006,31,,F,"I was meditating, as I had done hundreds of times before. All of the sudden, I had an experience that felt like a past-life experience. First, you should know that I am a petite female (52, very slender). But in my meditation, all of the sudden I was sitting on a horse and it was sometime around the 10th or 12th century. I was a large man. I could feel my heft. I was wearing a helmet and some kind of armor and vest that had a chain design of some sort. It was heavy.  I had just returned from war. I was going home to my wife and children. I was sitting on my horse, on a hill, looking down at the house towards the right. It was a very long single story house that had a series of very small windows that ran horizontally across the house, and it had a dark roof that looked like it was made of straw or some textured material. It was a dark color and I could see lights from candles inside the house. I knew my wife and children were in there, waiting for my return. I sat and looked at the house and had a feeling of sadness. I was happy to be home but I felt that this life was so hard, war was so hard. It was just a feeling of life being a burden, and feeling sad about all of it. The house was down towards my right, below the hill, and if I looked to my left I could see a harbor which is where I had some from. There were boats. I remember that it was very cold. And I remember that I could feel my heft. Like I could actually feel what it felt like to be that large. I knew what the name of the harbor was. Then all of the sudden I was standing on something that is hard to describe it was like a wooden platform or large wood cart with wheels and it was being pulled by horses. I was standing on it and holding the reigns while the horses pulled this thing I was standing on. We were entering a castle. I worked at the castle. I was some kind of fighter. And then I came up out of my meditation.

3063,ADC,1492,29,,F,"At the time, I had been teaching at a certain elementary school for about a year. I didnt really know any other teachers, just kept to those in my grade level. I had a dream one night about a co-workers father. I didnt know this co-worker, barely knew her first name. I didnt even talk to her as we werent even in the same grade level. It was odd that I would randomly dream about her as she was just an acquaintance. In the dream, I entered a bedroom of what seemed to be an older home. I saw this co-workers father, sitting up in a twin sized bed which was up against the wall. He was very happy, smiling, motioned me to come near him. I noticed his hands were at his heart, as if showing me he was in pain or had been in pain. Then he told me that his heart did indeed hurt, but that he wanted me to tell his daughter that he loved her very much. He did this without actually speaking. It was nonverbal communication. Thats all I remember about the dream.

3066,ME ,1507,20,,M,"After driving to my friends house after the concert we packed into his basement. No parents were home. Now at 12:30 at night I thought the effects of the mushrooms were wearing off. After staring at a spiral tapestry for a moment, I spun into a deep state of transcendence. I have had experience with psychedelics before in the past but never experienced anything close to what happened next. I sat in a circular cozy sofa and closed my eyes and my consciousness entered a dimension where it felt as if I had tapped into an eternal network of knowledge. Bursts of ideas regarding life and its wonders popped into my consciousness like bubbles, each identifying value which could not be explained by words very easily. An understanding of love was undeniable as it clearly is the adhesive force binding all of life. I understood that life requires a balance of the extremes and that death is nothing to fear but simply the critical point where our spirits transcend the physical realm. I could not see anything worth noting but the knowledge brought to my attention introduced me to the most profound spiritual presence I could ever ask to experience. This went o for roughly 5 hours as I would open my eyes occasionally and enter reality briefly only yo close them and dive back into the network.    ",,    Q.

3067,ME ,1496,28,,M,"In the dream, I was sitting looking into a room through a scrim of some sort so I could see but not be seen. Next to me was my wife at the time. Everything was suffused with a gold light and in the room ahead I could see a body lying on a bier. My wife said, Look, youre dead. I said, No, Im just sleeping. There seemed to be no contradiction at the time to being the observer of my body in the other room. She said, Look at the people. Indeed, there were people walking by the bier and I could see by their faces they were there paying their last respects. It struck me then that I had indeed died. I was almost immediately filled with enormous pain, sorrow and regret. I had all kinds of things I still planned to do. If I were to die there were people I wanted to say goodbye to but the time had passed. I could not go back or speak to any of the people in the other room in any way they could understand. The pain and regret lasted perhaps 20 minutes (in dream time) and my companion waited patiently until I was ready to move on. During those 20 minutes all the prior things that had seemed so important just faded away. I was now on a new and different journey where nothing of my previous life was important or relevant any more. I was not ready to move on, but I awoke with all Id seen.

The spaces between my thoughts, the stillness from which all thought arises, became alive as a vibrating, pulsating energy. I use the analogy of imagining that there was some kind of cosmic generator attached to me with a cord to the back of my head. This generator was directly attached to the very stuff of consciousness; to the energy which is present in the stillness which lies behind thoughts and emotions. And this generator was gradually turning up the juice; as much as I could handle. This energy was not experienced as a physical sensation (although there were some physical correlates to it).

3073,PLR,1199,37,,M,"When I looked at the map, it took me to India. Now, it is important to know that I had NEVER studied anything about India or its culture up to this point, even though I have always cooked with their spices, been attracted to their clothing, and always felt drawn to learning Ayurveda.  On the map of India, it drew me to an area called Gujarat (again, I had never heard of this place, but when I googled it, it was exactly where I was shown on the map). Making things more interesting, one of my spirit guides is named Ajwa, and there are streets and parks in Gujarat named Ajwa.  The next thing I knew, I was mentally whisked to a beautiful area, and to a house where I lived with my mother and father. At first it was nice and peaceful and I felt at home. I was female and in brightly colored clothes that I loved. I remember the area was so green and lush. My mother and father there were my brother and wife in this life. This was the mid 1800s, and the British military were there.  They came in the night and took my mother away to rape and kill her. I remember the panic I felt knowing I would never see her again. What is really interesting is that prior to this event, I was always terrified of my wife getting kidnapped and killed. Since this event, I have no fear because I know it is left over from India. Anyway, the English soldiers came back the next day and burned our village. I was raped and my nipples cut off. I remember being held down in one of the buildings, like a stable, as others looked on.
